<p><a name="high-art"> </a></p>
<h2>High art</h2>
<h3>Bastion</h3>
<p>Beautiful graphics, fun combat, well-executed story. Really feels like you are
inhabiting the character.</p>
<p>Good if you like: pretty action RPGs that aren't too challenging.</p>
<p>Finished: 3x (26 hours)</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, the studio has a new one coming</p>
<h3>Braid</h3>
<p>Excellent puzzles with an excellent story.</p>
<p>Good if you like: Mario and literature.</p>
<p>Finished: yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>FTL</h3>
<p>Rich, entertaining. Many play styles possible.</p>
<p>Good if you like: micro-tactics in space, and death.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, but noooooo</p>
<p>Plan to replay: 117 hours and counting</p>
<h3>FEZ</h3>
<p>Phil Fish is an artist. FEZ is perfect. I was shameless about using the
internet to get un-stuck, but did plenty on my own.</p>
<p>Much better with a controller.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, and yes. And yes. (12 hours)</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe in five years</p>
<h3>Dungeon of the Endless</h3>
<p>Some of the most original, yet familiar gameplay I've ever seen. Despite it
being "smaller," I've played this game more than Endless Legend, the 4X game
from the same studio.</p>
<p>Finished: see FTL</p>
<p>Plan to replay: 55 hours and counting</p>
<h3>Rogue Legacy</h3>
<p>Few games have sucked me in so fast for so long. Rogue Legacy is immaculately
balanced, plentiful in variety, nice to look at, and joyfully humorous.</p>
<p>Good if you like: action roguelikes, dying a lot, waving your sword around</p>
<p>Finished: in progress (22 hours)</p>
<p>Plan to replay: yes</p>
<h3>The Secret of Monkey Island</h3>
<p>The old version, without voice acting. One of the best adventure games ever
made.</p>
<p>Finished: 2x</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<p><a name="very-good"> </a></p>
<h2>Very good</h2>
<p>(For some subset of people.)</p>
<h3>Aquaria</h3>
<p>Excellent design, storytelling, and visuals. I got worn out about a third of
the way through it and stopped, but that was about 8 hours of play. I do
recommend it even though I didn't finish.</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: I actually tried but couldn't get into it again</p>
<h3>Avadon: The Black Fortress</h3>
<p>Spiderweb Software (i.e. Jeff Vogel) has been making isometric turn-based RPGs
since 1994. Avadon has all of Spiderweb's characteristic features of a one-man
RPG:</p>
<ul>
<li>The story is told through walls of text</li>
<li>The same tile set is used in most games with tweaks and additions</li>
<li>There are lots of well-balanced items</li>
<li>The UI is well-refined</li>
</ul>
<p>I've never finished a Spiderweb RPG; even at the easier difficulties, I tend to
get stuck because I can never quite figure out how to spend my XP efficiently.
However, I own three of them and have dumped probably a hundred or two hours
into all three collectively.</p>
<p>Anything from Spiderweb is worth your time if you like old-school RPGs.</p>
<p>Finished: no, but who cares</p>
<p>Plan to replay: yes</p>
<p>The entirety of this review also applies to Avernum 4 and 5.</p>
<h3>The Binding of Isaac</h3>
<p>I haven't been able to get into this yet, but I know people who love it. Rogue
Legacy tickles my action-roguelike fancies better.</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe</p>
<h3>BIT.TRIP RUNNER</h3>
<p>Stylistically excellent. I've only done the first world because the last level
is too hard, but I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: yes</p>
<h3>Cogs</h3>
<p>Well-designed and fun to play. Decision tree puzzles were not sufficient to
keep me engaged.</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Creeper World 3</h3>
<p>A real-time strategy game about graphs. It is intensely nerdy, explores its
whole gameplay idea space, and is pretty damn fun.</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: yes</p>
<h3>Darwinia</h3>
<p>Very pretty. I wish it were longer. The little green guys have some frustrating
behavior bugs that often break immersion.</p>
<p>Finished: yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: yes</p>
<h3>Dungeon Defenders</h3>
<p>This game helped keep my LDR alive. Fun and beginner-friendly up to a point,
then it's suddenly punishingly difficult. We stopped at that point.</p>
<p>You need a friend to play this game.</p>
<p>Finished: basic campaign</p>
<p>Plan to replay: if the occasion arises</p>
<h3>Frozen Synapse</h3>
<p>Fascinating concept. A-minus execution.</p>
<p>Good if you like: turn-based tactics.</p>
<p>Finished: all but last level (no particular reason)</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Gone Home</h3>
<p>A touching story. That's the game.</p>
<p>Finished: yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, but once was definitely enough</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>Creepy adventure game. Good for the experience, but quite unsatisfying on
several levels. I think the lack of satisfaction is also part of the
experience...but I don't find that explanation satisfying.</p>
<p>Finished: yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Hotline Miami</h3>
<p>Violent. Mysterious. Awesome.</p>
<p>Good if you like: getting in fights</p>
<p>Finished: no (lost my momentum)</p>
<p>Plan to replay: yes</p>
<h3>Jamestown</h3>
<p>Fun shooter. I didn't play much, but it's well done.</p>
<h3>Kentucky Route Zero</h3>
<p>Dreamlike adventure game. Only 2 out of 5 episodes are out. I've finished both.</p>
<h3>LIMBO</h3>
<p>Looks and feels great. I got worn out by constantly walking to the right and
never getting to the end. Lasted about 4 hours before I dropped it for more
interesting things.</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe</p>
<h3>Lugaru [HD]</h3>
<p>I think I enjoyed this so much because I was young. Now I'd need more of a
story or environment to stick with it. The mechanics are great.</p>
<p>Good if you like: getting in fights</p>
<p>Finished: no, but I sure played a lot</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, I'll buy Overgrowth instead (same developer)</p>
<h3>Lunar Flight</h3>
<p>Fly the Lunar Module on the moon. Heck yes! (I hope carrying cargo from A to B
is your idea of a good time. It certainly is for me.)</p>
<p>Finished: no, but 7 hours in</p>
<p>Plan to finish: maybe not, but a few more hours for sure</p>
<h3>Machinarium</h3>
<p>Fun adventure game. I had to look up hints online a few times but generally
enjoyed myself.</p>
<p>Finished: yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Mark of the Ninja</h3>
<p>Nice stealth game. Great controller support. Performance issues on OS X.</p>
<p>I only played 90 minutes, but I'll probably get back to it later.</p>
<h3>Minecraft before they added food</h3>
<p>Yeah, I'm a hipster. The current version is just bewildering to me. I just want
to explore caves!</p>
<h3>Monaco</h3>
<p>Conduct elaborate heists with friends.</p>
<p><strong>This game is so good,</strong> but you need friends to play it! The online community
is too inconsistent.</p>
<p>Finished: no (after 12 hours)</p>
<p>Plan to finish: yes, if I can set up enough play dates</p>
<h3>Penumbra (Overture, Black Plague, Requiem)</h3>
<p>Survival horror adventure. Evil Myst. These games were scary enough that I
haven't yet conjured the nerve to play this studio's next series, Amnesia.</p>
<p>Good if you like: soiled undergarments</p>
<p>Finished: yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, once was plenty</p>
<h3>Psychonauts</h3>
<p>Fantastic story and world. Platforming sometimes finicky. Twice as long as you
expect, which is very good.</p>
<p>Good if you like: Tim Schafer dialogue, weird things happening</p>
<p>Finished: yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe in five years</p>
<h3>Shovel Knight</h3>
<p>Among the glut of polished indie platformers, this one stands out. I think of
it as Rogue Legacy with handmade levels. If I had the time for twitchy games,
I'd play more of this.</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe</p>
<h3>Solar 2</h3>
<p>For once, a physics-based game I actually like! Utterly charming. The final
boss was hard enough that I never beat it, but it was a fun 6 hours.</p>
<p>Finished: almost</p>
<p>Plan to replay: yes</p>
<h3>SpaceChem</h3>
<p>For once, a puzzle game I actually like! Does a lot with a little. Exercises
your space-time reasoning very well.</p>
<p>Finished: no, but 20 hours is pretty good</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Super Hexagon</h3>
<p>Punishingly difficult, but you will improve, because Super Hexagon will change
your brain.</p>
<p>Finished: doesn't matter</p>
<p>Plan to replay: yes</p>
<h3>The Swapper</h3>
<p>Mechanically simple puzzle platformer with stunning atmosphere, plot, and
visuals. The developers made very good choices about where to spend their time.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, 3 hours</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, once was enough</p>
<h3>Sword &amp; Sworcery EP</h3>
<p>Dreamlike adventure game. The soundtrack makes it.</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, once was enough</p>
<h3>Thomas Was Alone</h3>
<p>This is a platformer, but it's also art.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, 61m</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Trace Vector</h3>
<p>I'm a sucker for well-made retro arcade games. Trace Vector is simple,
original, and pretty.</p>
<p>Finished: no, but I will.</p>
<h3>The Walking Dead</h3>
<p>Entertaining casual adventure game.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, 21 hours for 5 episodes and DLC</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>World of Goo</h3>
<p>It's been a couple of years since I played through World of Goo, but I remember
it being utterly entertaining.</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe</p>
<p><a name="if-you-need-something-to-do"> </a></p>
<h2>If you need something to do</h2>
<p>(Get it in a bundle.)</p>
<h3>BIT.TRIP BEAT</h3>
<p>Simplistic, entertaining. My mouse hand tends to drift because the X axis is
ignored.</p>
<h3>Blocks That Matter</h3>
<p>Puzzle platformers with weak stories and ho-hum mechanics are not my thing.</p>
<h3>Cave Story</h3>
<p>It's been too long since I played this. I stopped after 4-5 hours, don't
remember why. It's like a really good Gameboy game.</p>
<h3>EDGE</h3>
<p>Cute action-puzzle. I stopped playing it because I don't like games that are
primarily skill challenges against a clock, particularly when they require
twitch reflexes. I'll probably try again with a controller.</p>
<h3>Fractal: Make Blooms Not War</h3>
<p>Good for a twenty-minute mind-clearing. Simple and relaxing.</p>
<h3>Gish</h3>
<p>Atmospheric and interesting platformer with okay mechanics. I probably put 3
hours into it.</p>
<h3>Gratuitous Space Battles</h3>
<p>Fun (I played about 5 hours) but shallow. I would enjoy this more if I was 12
(which is not an insult).</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Little Inferno</h3>
<p>Pretty and pointless. That's the point.</p>
<p>I internetted my way through it really quickly because I just wanted to see the
end without the boring game part.</p>
<p>Finished: ha.</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no.</p>
<h3>McPixel</h3>
<p>Have a few drinks and sit down with a friend. Play for twenty minutes. Giggle a
lot. Forget about it forever.</p>
<p>Finished: no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Organ Trail: Director's Cut</h3>
<p>It's pretty much what you'd think. Stylistically spot-on. Balanced enough to
keep me in it for 3 hours, but you really only need 1.</p>
<p>Finished: yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Osmos</h3>
<p>Lovely way to pass the time on an iPad.</p>
<p>Finished: mostly</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no</p>
<h3>Papers, Please</h3>
<p>I'll finish this eventually. Glory to Arstotzka!</p>
<h3>Proteus</h3>
<p>Fun to walk around in for an hour (which is exactly what I did). Don't be
afraid to look up a secret or two online.</p>
<p>Finished: more or less</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe</p>
<h3>Revenge of the Titans</h3>
<p>Conventional tower defense. Not really my scene.</p>
<h3>Voxatron</h3>
<p>Looked cool, but that didn't translate to good gameplay. Jump and shoot, jump
and shoot.</p>
<h3>Wizorb</h3>
<p>Arkanoid: The RPG. Another in the "really good Gameboy game" category.</p>
<h3>Zen Bound 2</h3>
<p>Very physical-feeling puzzle game. Also very zen.</p>
<p><a name="insufficiently-entertaining"> </a></p>
<h2>Insufficiently entertaining</h2>
<p>(I can see how other people would enjoy these games.)</p>
<h3>And Yet It Moves</h3>
<p>Bouncing ball is not compelling character. Physics engine is not compelling
world.</p>
<h3>Anodyne</h3>
<p>Seems like the story might be good, but combat is boring and the environments
are monotonous.</p>
<h3>Bad Hotel</h3>
<p>I wanted to make a game like this once. Now I'm glad I didn't.</p>
<p>You make a tower of blocks which are guns or powerups. Stuff flies at you and
tries to knock it down.</p>
<p>Maybe it's more fun on a phone. I played it on a Mac.</p>
<h3>BIT.TRIP CORE</h3>
<p>Controller setup is bad and not configurable. (I hate D-pads.) Keyboard control
is awkward. As a fan of Super Hexagon, I can see myself getting into this a lot
for a week or two, but without good controls I can't.</p>
<h3>The Bridge</h3>
<p>The art style is interesting, but it's slow and lacks variety in gameplay or
graphics.</p>
<h3>Broken Sword 1: Shadow of the Templars</h3>
<p>Bad voice acting. Inconsistent art. Mediocre puzzle design.</p>
<h3>Brütal Legend</h3>
<p>I want to like it, but it just runs so badly on OS X. Pretty bewildering
UI/control-wise for the first hour as well.</p>
<h3>Dungeons of Dredmor</h3>
<p>I don't remember it being <em>bad</em>, but I was not sufficiently entertained. There
are better roguelikes.</p>
<h3>Dustforce</h3>
<p>So-so platformer with the thinnest veil of a story.</p>
<h3>Dynamite Jack</h3>
<p>I was bored after 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>Electronic Super Joy</h3>
<p>Fast action platformer. The "Aaaah!"s got old so fast that I stopped playing
after 15 minutes. I'll probably try again to see if it gets interesting, but
it's generally a sensory overload.</p>
<h3>English Country Tune</h3>
<p>Spatial decision tree puzzles. Graphics are very basic. Bored after 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>Escape Velocity (original, Override, Nova)</h3>
<p>I played these games collectively for probably 200 hours, so what are they
doing in here? They don't stand the test of time. They are boring and
unbalanced by today's space combat standards.</p>
<p>But making mods was amazing and fun, and why I learned so much about resource
forks in Mac OS ≤ 9.</p>
<p>Despite my complaints about its dated combat, I haven't yet found a game that
has the same kind of slow-paced space fight and enormous story. There's room
for a game like that today, but it would probably need to have better AI and be
in 3D.</p>
<h3>Hack, Slash, Loot</h3>
<p>Combat, story, and graphics all too simplistic. Baby's First Roguelike. I am
not a baby.</p>
<h3>Hammerfight</h3>
<p>I have made games like this before. None of them were good. They start with a
programmer saying "let's take the physics engine hand have the player swing
stuff around." It's only fun if you programmed it.</p>
<h3>Incredipede</h3>
<p>Another frustrating physics game without much in the way of story. Looks pretty
though.</p>
<h3>Legend of Dungeon</h3>
<p>Mediocre "early access" toy. Bad controls and bad UI. Try again in two years.</p>
<h3>Legend of Grimrock</h3>
<p>Monotonous. There are better roguelikes.</p>
<p><em>After reading reviews of Grimrock, I'm convinced I should give it another
shot.</em></p>
<h3>Rochard</h3>
<p>Fun for a while, but the mechanics are pretty shallow.</p>
<h3>Space Pirates And Zombies</h3>
<p>Bad tutorial, ugly graphics.</p>
<h3>Splice</h3>
<p>The most basic decision tree puzzles imaginable.</p>
<h3>Stacking</h3>
<p>It's fun to watch old movies. It's less fun to do a thousand fetch quests.</p>
<h3>Uplink</h3>
<p>I got really into this for a couple of weeks in high school, but when I picked
it up again last year it was boring and tedious.</p>
<h3>VVVVV</h3>
<p>Good platformer, but I want more than just good platforming.</p>
<p><a name="avoid"> </a></p>
<h2>Avoid</h2>
<h3>BIT.TRIP FATE</h3>
<p>Confusing, bizarre, unsatisfying. Nothing to do with rhythm.</p>
<h3>Shank</h3>
<p>Good fighting mechanics ruined by misogynist drivel.</p>
<h3>Super Meat Boy on OS X</h3>
<p>I realize you might kill me for this. But the truth is, the Mac port is awful.
No fullscreen, no controller configuration, crashes, etc.</p>
<h3>Worms Reloaded on OS X</h3>
<p>Bad port is bad.</p>
