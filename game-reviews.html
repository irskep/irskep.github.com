Really feels like you are inhabiting the&nbsp;character.</p> <p>Good if you like: pretty action RPGs that aren&#8217;t too&nbsp;challenging.</p> <p>Finished: 3x (26&nbsp;hours)</p> <p>Plan to replay: no, the studio has a new one&nbsp;coming</p> <h3>Braid</h3> <p>Excellent puzzles with an excellent&nbsp;story.</p> <p>Good if you like: Mario and&nbsp;literature.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3><span class=caps>FTL</span></h3> <p>Rich, entertaining. Many play styles&nbsp;possible.</p> <p>Good if you like: micro-tactics in space, and&nbsp;death.</p> <p>Finished: yes, but&nbsp;noooooo</p> <p>Plan to replay: 117 hours and&nbsp;counting</p> <h3><span class=caps>FEZ</span></h3> <p>Phil Fish is an artist. <span class=caps>FEZ</span> is perfect. I was shameless about using the internet to get un-stuck, but did plenty on my&nbsp;own.</p> <p>Much better with a&nbsp;controller.</p> <p>Finished: yes, and yes. And yes. (12&nbsp;hours)</p> <p>Plan to replay: maybe in five&nbsp;years</p> <h3>Dungeon of the&nbsp;Endless</h3> <p>Some of the most original, yet familiar gameplay I&#8217;ve ever seen. Despite it being &#8220;smaller,&#8221; I&#8217;ve played this game more than Endless Legend, the 4X game from the same&nbsp;studio.</p> <p>Finished: see <span class=caps>FTL</span></p> <p>Plan to replay: 55 hours and&nbsp;counting</p> <h3>Rogue&nbsp;Legacy</h3> <p>Few games have sucked me in so fast for so long. Rogue Legacy is immaculately balanced, plentiful in variety, nice to look at, and joyfully&nbsp;humorous.</p> <p>Good if you like: action roguelikes, dying a lot, waving your sword&nbsp;around</p> <p>Finished: in progress (22&nbsp;hours)</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p> <h3>The Secret of Monkey&nbsp;Island</h3> <p>The old version, without voice acting. One of the best adventure games ever&nbsp;made.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;2x</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <p><a name=very-good> </a></p> <h2>Very&nbsp;good</h2> <p>(For some subset of&nbsp;people.)</p> <h3>Aquaria</h3> <p>Excellent design, storytelling, and visuals. I got worn out about a third of the way through it and stopped, but that was about 8 hours of play. I do recommend it even though I didn&#8217;t&nbsp;finish.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay: I actually tried but couldn&#8217;t get into it&nbsp;again</p> <h3>Avadon: The Black&nbsp;Fortress</h3> <p>Spiderweb Software (i.e. Jeff Vogel) has been making isometric turn-based RPGs since 1994. Avadon has all of Spiderweb&#8217;s characteristic features of a one-man <span class=caps>RPG</span>:</p> <ul> <li>The story is told through walls of&nbsp;text</li> <li>The same tile set is used in most games with tweaks and&nbsp;additions</li> <li>There are lots of well-balanced&nbsp;items</li> <li>The <span class=caps>UI</span> is&nbsp;well-refined</li> </ul> <p>I&#8217;ve never finished a Spiderweb <span class=caps>RPG</span>; even at the easier difficulties, I tend to get stuck because I can never quite figure out how to spend my <span class=caps>XP</span> efficiently. However, I own three of them and have dumped probably a hundred or two hours into all three&nbsp;collectively.</p> <p>Anything from Spiderweb is worth your time if you like old-school&nbsp;RPGs.</p> <p>Finished: no, but who&nbsp;cares</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>The entirety of this review also applies to Avernum 4 and&nbsp;5.</p> <h3>The Binding of&nbsp;Isaac</h3> <p>I haven&#8217;t been able to get into this yet, but I know people who love it. Rogue Legacy tickles my action-roguelike fancies&nbsp;better.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p> <h3><span class=caps>BIT</span>.<span class=caps>TRIP</span> <span class=caps>RUNNER</span></h3> <p>Stylistically excellent. I&#8217;ve only done the first world because the last level is too hard, but I enjoyed&nbsp;it.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p> <h3>Cogs</h3> <p>Well-designed and fun to play. Decision tree puzzles were not sufficient to keep me&nbsp;engaged.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Creeper World&nbsp;3</h3> <p>A real-time strategy game about graphs. It is intensely nerdy, explores its whole gameplay idea space, and is pretty damn&nbsp;fun.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p> <h3>Darwinia</h3> <p>Very pretty. I wish it were longer. The little green guys have some frustrating behavior bugs that often break&nbsp;immersion.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p> <h3>Dungeon&nbsp;Defenders</h3> <p>This game helped keep my <span class=caps>LDR</span> alive. Fun and beginner-friendly up to a point, then it&#8217;s suddenly punishingly difficult. We stopped at that&nbsp;point.</p> <p>You need a friend to play this&nbsp;game.</p> <p>Finished: basic&nbsp;campaign</p> <p>Plan to replay: if the occasion&nbsp;arises</p> <h3>Frozen&nbsp;Synapse</h3> <p>Fascinating concept. A-minus&nbsp;execution.</p> <p>Good if you like: turn-based&nbsp;tactics.</p> <p>Finished: all but last level (no particular&nbsp;reason)</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Gone&nbsp;Home</h3> <p>A touching story. That&#8217;s the&nbsp;game.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>Plan to replay: no, but once was definitely&nbsp;enough</p> <h3>Home</h3> <p>Creepy adventure game. Good for the experience, but quite unsatisfying on several levels. I think the lack of satisfaction is also part of the experience&#8230;but I don&#8217;t find that explanation&nbsp;satisfying.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Hotline&nbsp;Miami</h3> <p>Violent. Mysterious.&nbsp;Awesome.</p> <p>Good if you like: getting in&nbsp;fights</p> <p>Finished: no (lost my&nbsp;momentum)</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p> <h3>Jamestown</h3> <p>Fun shooter. I didn&#8217;t play much, but it&#8217;s well&nbsp;done.</p> <h3>Kentucky Route&nbsp;Zero</h3> <p>Dreamlike adventure game. Only 2 out of 5 episodes are out. I&#8217;ve finished&nbsp;both.</p> <h3><span class=caps>LIMBO</span></h3> <p>Looks and feels great. I got worn out by constantly walking to the right and never getting to the end. Lasted about 4 hours before I dropped it for more interesting&nbsp;things.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p> <h3>Lugaru [<span class=caps>HD</span>]</h3> <p>I think I enjoyed this so much because I was young. Now I&#8217;d need more of a story or environment to stick with it. The mechanics are&nbsp;great.</p> <p>Good if you like: getting in&nbsp;fights</p> <p>Finished: no, but I sure played a&nbsp;lot</p> <p>Plan to replay: no, I&#8217;ll buy Overgrowth instead (same&nbsp;developer)</p> <h3>Lunar&nbsp;Flight</h3> <p>Fly the Lunar Module on the moon. Heck yes! (I hope carrying cargo from A to B is your idea of a good time. It certainly is for&nbsp;me.)</p> <p>Finished: no, but 7 hours&nbsp;in</p> <p>Plan to finish: maybe not, but a few more hours for&nbsp;sure</p> <h3>Machinarium</h3> <p>Fun adventure game. I had to look up hints online a few times but generally enjoyed&nbsp;myself.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Mark of the&nbsp;Ninja</h3> <p>Nice stealth game. Great controller support. Performance issues on <span class=caps>OS</span>&nbsp;X.</p> <p>I only played 90 minutes, but I&#8217;ll probably get back to it&nbsp;later.</p> <h3>Minecraft before they added&nbsp;food</h3> <p>Yeah, I&#8217;m a hipster. The current version is just bewildering to me. I just want to explore&nbsp;caves!</p> <h3>Monaco</h3> <p>Conduct elaborate heists with&nbsp;friends.</p> <p><strong>This game is so good,</strong> but you need friends to play it! The online community is too&nbsp;inconsistent.</p> <p>Finished: no (after 12&nbsp;hours)</p> <p>Plan to finish: yes, if I can set up enough play&nbsp;dates</p> <h3>Penumbra (Overture, Black Plague,&nbsp;Requiem)</h3> <p>Survival horror adventure. Evil Myst. These games were scary enough that I haven&#8217;t yet conjured the nerve to play this studio&#8217;s next series,&nbsp;Amnesia.</p> <p>Good if you like: soiled&nbsp;undergarments</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>Plan to replay: no, once was&nbsp;plenty</p> <h3>Psychonauts</h3> <p>Fantastic story and world. Platforming sometimes finicky. Twice as long as you expect, which is very&nbsp;good.</p> <p>Good if you like: Tim Schafer dialogue, weird things&nbsp;happening</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>Plan to replay: maybe in five&nbsp;years</p> <h3>Shovel&nbsp;Knight</h3> <p>Among the glut of polished indie platformers, this one stands out. I think of it as Rogue Legacy with handmade levels. If I had the time for twitchy games, I&#8217;d play more of&nbsp;this.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p> <h3>Solar&nbsp;2</h3> <p>For once, a physics-based game I actually like! Utterly charming. The final boss was hard enough that I never beat it, but it was a fun 6&nbsp;hours.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;almost</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p> <h3>SpaceChem</h3> <p>For once, a puzzle game I actually like! Does a lot with a little. Exercises your space-time reasoning very&nbsp;well.</p> <p>Finished: no, but 20 hours is pretty&nbsp;good</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Super&nbsp;Hexagon</h3> <p>Punishingly difficult, but you will improve, because Super Hexagon will change your&nbsp;brain.</p> <p>Finished: doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;matter</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p> <h3>The&nbsp;Swapper</h3> <p>Mechanically simple puzzle platformer with stunning atmosphere, plot, and visuals. The developers made very good choices about where to spend their&nbsp;time.</p> <p>Finished: yes, 3&nbsp;hours</p> <p>Plan to replay: no, once was&nbsp;enough</p> <h3>Sword <span class=amp>&amp;</span> Sworcery <span class=caps>EP</span></h3> <p>Dreamlike adventure game. The soundtrack makes&nbsp;it.</p> <p>Plan to replay: no, once was&nbsp;enough</p> <h3>Thomas Was&nbsp;Alone</h3> <p>This is a platformer, but it&#8217;s also&nbsp;art.</p> <p>Finished: yes,&nbsp;61m</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Trace&nbsp;Vector</h3> <p>I&#8217;m a sucker for well-made retro arcade games. Trace Vector is simple, original, and&nbsp;pretty.</p> <p>Finished: no, but I&nbsp;will.</p> <h3>The Walking&nbsp;Dead</h3> <p>Entertaining casual adventure&nbsp;game.</p> <p>Finished: yes, 21 hours for 5 episodes and <span class=caps>DLC</span></p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>World of&nbsp;Goo</h3> <p>It&#8217;s been a couple of years since I played through World of Goo, but I remember it being utterly&nbsp;entertaining.</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p> <p><a name=if-you-need-something-to-do> </a></p> <h2>If you need something to&nbsp;do</h2> <p>(Get it in a&nbsp;bundle.)</p> <h3><span class=caps>BIT</span>.<span class=caps>TRIP</span> <span class=caps>BEAT</span></h3> <p>Simplistic, entertaining. My mouse hand tends to drift because the X axis is&nbsp;ignored.</p> <h3>Blocks That&nbsp;Matter</h3> <p>Puzzle platformers with weak stories and ho-hum mechanics are not my&nbsp;thing.</p> <h3>Cave&nbsp;Story</h3> <p>It&#8217;s been too long since I played this. I stopped after 4-5 hours, don&#8217;t remember why. It&#8217;s like a really good Gameboy&nbsp;game.</p> <h3><span class=caps>EDGE</span></h3> <p>Cute action-puzzle. I stopped playing it because I don&#8217;t like games that are primarily skill challenges against a clock, particularly when they require twitch reflexes. I&#8217;ll probably try again with a&nbsp;controller.</p> <h3>Fractal: Make Blooms Not&nbsp;War</h3> <p>Good for a twenty-minute mind-clearing. Simple and&nbsp;relaxing.</p> <h3>Gish</h3> <p>Atmospheric and interesting platformer with okay mechanics. I probably put 3 hours into&nbsp;it.</p> <h3>Gratuitous Space&nbsp;Battles</h3> <p>Fun (I played about 5 hours) but shallow. I would enjoy this more if I was 12 (which is not an&nbsp;insult).</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Little&nbsp;Inferno</h3> <p>Pretty and pointless. That&#8217;s the&nbsp;point.</p> <p>I internetted my way through it really quickly because I just wanted to see the end without the boring game&nbsp;part.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;ha.</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no.</p> <h3>McPixel</h3> <p>Have a few drinks and sit down with a friend. Play for twenty minutes. Giggle a lot. Forget about it&nbsp;forever.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Organ Trail: Director&#8217;s&nbsp;Cut</h3> <p>It&#8217;s pretty much what you&#8217;d think. Stylistically spot-on. Balanced enough to keep me in it for 3 hours, but you really only need&nbsp;1.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Osmos</h3> <p>Lovely way to pass the time on an&nbsp;iPad.</p> <p>Finished:&nbsp;mostly</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p> <h3>Papers,&nbsp;Please</h3> <p>I&#8217;ll finish this eventually. Glory to&nbsp;Arstotzka!</p> <h3>Proteus</h3> <p>Fun to walk around in for an hour (which is exactly what I did). Don&#8217;t be afraid to look up a secret or two&nbsp;online.</p> <p>Finished: more or&nbsp;less</p> <p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p> <h3>Revenge of the&nbsp;Titans</h3> <p>Conventional tower defense. Not really my&nbsp;scene.</p> <h3>Voxatron</h3> <p>Looked cool, but that didn&#8217;t translate to good gameplay. Jump and shoot, jump and&nbsp;shoot.</p> <h3>Wizorb</h3> <p>Arkanoid: The <span class=caps>RPG</span>. Another in the &#8220;really good Gameboy game&#8221;&nbsp;category.</p> <h3>Zen Bound&nbsp;2</h3> <p>Very physical-feeling puzzle game. Also very&nbsp;zen.</p> <p><a name=insufficiently-entertaining> </a></p> <h2>Insufficiently&nbsp;entertaining</h2> <p>(I can see how other people would enjoy these&nbsp;games.)</p> <h3>And Yet It&nbsp;Moves</h3> <p>Bouncing ball is not compelling character. Physics engine is not compelling&nbsp;world.</p> <h3>Anodyne</h3> <p>Seems like the story might be good, but combat is boring and the environments are&nbsp;monotonous.</p> <h3>Bad&nbsp;Hotel</h3> <p>I wanted to make a game like this once. Now I&#8217;m glad I&nbsp;didn&#8217;t.</p> <p>You make a tower of blocks which are guns or powerups. Stuff flies at you and tries to knock it&nbsp;down.</p> <p>Maybe it&#8217;s more fun on a phone. I played it on a&nbsp;Mac.</p> <h3><span class=caps>BIT</span>.<span class=caps>TRIP</span> <span class=caps>CORE</span></h3> <p>Controller setup is bad and not configurable. (I hate D-pads.) Keyboard control is awkward. As a fan of Super Hexagon, I can see myself getting into this a lot for a week or two, but without good controls I&nbsp;can&#8217;t.</p> <h3>The&nbsp;Bridge</h3> <p>The art style is interesting, but it&#8217;s slow and lacks variety in gameplay or&nbsp;graphics.</p> <h3>Broken Sword 1: Shadow of the&nbsp;Templars</h3> <p>Bad voice acting. Inconsistent art. Mediocre puzzle&nbsp;design.</p> <h3>BrÃ¼tal&nbsp;Legend</h3> <p>I want to like it, but it just runs so badly on <span class=caps>OS</span> X. Pretty bewildering <span class=caps>UI</span>/control-wise for the first hour as&nbsp;well.</p> <h3>Dungeons of&nbsp;Dredmor</h3> <p>I don&#8217;t remember it being <em>bad</em>, but I was not sufficiently entertained. There are better&nbsp;roguelikes.</p> <h3>Dustforce</h3> <p>So-so platformer with the thinnest veil of a&nbsp;story.</p> <h3>Dynamite&nbsp;Jack</h3> <p>I was bored after 15&nbsp;minutes.</p> <h3>Electronic Super&nbsp;Joy</h3> <p>Fast action platformer. The &#8220;Aaaah!&#8221;s got old so fast that I stopped playing after 15 minutes. I&#8217;ll probably try again to see if it gets interesting, but it&#8217;s generally a sensory&nbsp;overload.</p> <h3>English Country&nbsp;Tune</h3> <p>Spatial decision tree puzzles. Graphics are very basic. Bored after 15&nbsp;minutes.</p> <h3>Escape Velocity (original, Override,&nbsp;Nova)</h3> <p>I played these games collectively for probably 200 hours, so what are they doing in here? They don&#8217;t stand the test of time. They are boring and unbalanced by today&#8217;s space combat&nbsp;standards.</p> <p>But making mods was amazing and fun, and why I learned so much about resource forks in Mac <span class=caps>OS</span> â¤&nbsp;9.</p> <p>Despite my complaints about its dated combat, I haven&#8217;t yet found a game that has the same kind of slow-paced space fight and enormous story. There&#8217;s room for a game like that today, but it would probably need to have better <span class=caps>AI</span> and be in&nbsp;3D.</p> <h3>Hack, Slash,&nbsp;Loot</h3> <p>Combat, story, and graphics all too simplistic. Baby&#8217;s First Roguelike. I am not a&nbsp;baby.</p> <h3>Hammerfight</h3> <p>I have made games like this before. None of them were good. They start with a programmer saying &#8220;let&#8217;s take the physics engine hand have the player swing stuff around.&#8221; It&#8217;s only fun if you programmed&nbsp;it.</p> <h3>Incredipede</h3> <p>Another frustrating physics game without much in the way of story. Looks pretty&nbsp;though.</p> <h3>Legend of&nbsp;Dungeon</h3> <p>Mediocre &#8220;early access&#8221; toy. Bad controls and bad <span class=caps>UI</span>. Try again in two&nbsp;years.</p> <h3>Legend of&nbsp;Grimrock</h3> <p>Monotonous. There are better&nbsp;roguelikes.</p> <p><em>After reading reviews of Grimrock, I&#8217;m convinced I should give it another&nbsp;shot.</em></p> <h3>Rochard</h3> <p>Fun for a while, but the mechanics are pretty&nbsp;shallow.</p> <h3>Space Pirates And&nbsp;Zombies</h3> <p>Bad tutorial, ugly&nbsp;graphics.</p> <h3>Splice</h3> <p>The most basic decision tree puzzles&nbsp;imaginable.</p> <h3>Stacking</h3> <p>It&#8217;s fun to watch old movies. It&#8217;s less fun to do a thousand fetch&nbsp;quests.</p> <h3>Uplink</h3> <p>I got really into this for a couple of weeks in high school, but when I picked it up again last year it was boring and&nbsp;tedious.</p> <h3><span class=caps>VVVVV</span></h3> <p>Good platformer, but I want more than just good&nbsp;platforming.</p> <p><a name=avoid> </a></p> <h2>Avoid</h2> <h3><span class=caps>BIT</span>.<span class=caps>TRIP</span> <span class=caps>FATE</span></h3> <p>Confusing, bizarre, unsatisfying. Nothing to do with&nbsp;rhythm.</p> <h3>Shank</h3> <p>Good fighting mechanics ruined by misogynist&nbsp;drivel.</p> <h3>Super Meat Boy on <span class=caps>OS</span>&nbsp;X</h3> <p>I realize you might kill me for this. But the truth is, the Mac port is awful. No fullscreen, no controller configuration, crashes,&nbsp;etc.</p> <h3>Worms Reloaded on <span class=caps>OS</span>&nbsp;X</h3> <p>Bad port is&nbsp;bad.</p> </div> </article> </section> </main> </div> <script type=text/javascript>
