<p><a name="high-art"> </a></p>
<h2 id="high-art">High&nbsp;art</h2>
<h3 id="bastion">Bastion</h3>
<p>Beautiful graphics, fun combat, well-executed story. Really feels like you are
inhabiting the&nbsp;character.</p>
<p>Good if you like: pretty action RPGs that aren&#8217;t too&nbsp;challenging.</p>
<p>Finished: 3x (26&nbsp;hours)</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, the studio has a new one&nbsp;coming</p>
<h3 id="braid">Braid</h3>
<p>Excellent puzzles with an excellent&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>Good if you like: Mario and&nbsp;literature.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="ftl"><span class="caps">FTL</span></h3>
<p>Rich, entertaining. Many play styles&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Good if you like: micro-tactics in space, and&nbsp;death.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, but&nbsp;noooooo</p>
<p>Plan to replay: 117 hours and&nbsp;counting</p>
<h3 id="fez"><span class="caps">FEZ</span></h3>
<p>Phil Fish is an artist. <span class="caps">FEZ</span> is perfect. I was shameless about using the
internet to get un-stuck, but did plenty on my&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>Much better with a&nbsp;controller.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, and yes. And yes. (12&nbsp;hours)</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe in five&nbsp;years</p>
<h3 id="dungeon-of-the-endless">Dungeon of the&nbsp;Endless</h3>
<p>Some of the most original, yet familiar gameplay I&#8217;ve ever seen. Despite it
being &#8220;smaller,&#8221; I&#8217;ve played this game more than Endless Legend, the 4X game
from the same&nbsp;studio.</p>
<p>Finished: see <span class="caps">FTL</span></p>
<p>Plan to replay: 55 hours and&nbsp;counting</p>
<h3 id="rogue-legacy">Rogue&nbsp;Legacy</h3>
<p>Few games have sucked me in so fast for so long. Rogue Legacy is immaculately
balanced, plentiful in variety, nice to look at, and joyfully&nbsp;humorous.</p>
<p>Good if you like: action roguelikes, dying a lot, waving your sword&nbsp;around</p>
<p>Finished: in progress (22&nbsp;hours)</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p>
<h3 id="the-secret-of-monkey-island">The Secret of Monkey&nbsp;Island</h3>
<p>The old version, without voice acting. One of the best adventure games ever&nbsp;made.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;2x</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<p><a name="very-good"> </a></p>
<h2 id="very-good">Very&nbsp;good</h2>
<p>(For some subset of&nbsp;people.)</p>
<h3 id="aquaria">Aquaria</h3>
<p>Excellent design, storytelling, and visuals. I got worn out about a third of
the way through it and stopped, but that was about 8 hours of play. I do
recommend it even though I didn&#8217;t&nbsp;finish.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay: I actually tried but couldn&#8217;t get into it&nbsp;again</p>
<h3 id="avadon-the-black-fortress">Avadon: The Black&nbsp;Fortress</h3>
<p>Spiderweb Software (i.e. Jeff Vogel) has been making isometric turn-based RPGs
since 1994. Avadon has all of Spiderweb&#8217;s characteristic features of a one-man
<span class="caps">RPG</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The story is told through walls of&nbsp;text</li>
<li>The same tile set is used in most games with tweaks and&nbsp;additions</li>
<li>There are lots of well-balanced&nbsp;items</li>
<li>The <span class="caps">UI</span> is&nbsp;well-refined</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve never finished a Spiderweb <span class="caps">RPG</span>; even at the easier difficulties, I tend to
get stuck because I can never quite figure out how to spend my <span class="caps">XP</span> efficiently.
However, I own three of them and have dumped probably a hundred or two hours
into all three&nbsp;collectively.</p>
<p>Anything from Spiderweb is worth your time if you like old-school&nbsp;RPGs.</p>
<p>Finished: no, but who&nbsp;cares</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>The entirety of this review also applies to Avernum 4 and&nbsp;5.</p>
<h3 id="the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of&nbsp;Isaac</h3>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been able to get into this yet, but I know people who love it. Rogue
Legacy tickles my action-roguelike fancies&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p>
<h3 id="bittrip-runner"><span class="caps">BIT</span>.<span class="caps">TRIP</span> <span class="caps">RUNNER</span></h3>
<p>Stylistically excellent. I&#8217;ve only done the first world because the last level
is too hard, but I enjoyed&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p>
<h3 id="cogs">Cogs</h3>
<p>Well-designed and fun to play. Decision tree puzzles were not sufficient to
keep me&nbsp;engaged.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="creeper-world-3">Creeper World&nbsp;3</h3>
<p>A real-time strategy game about graphs. It is intensely nerdy, explores its
whole gameplay idea space, and is pretty damn&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p>
<h3 id="darwinia">Darwinia</h3>
<p>Very pretty. I wish it were longer. The little green guys have some frustrating
behavior bugs that often break&nbsp;immersion.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p>
<h3 id="dungeon-defenders">Dungeon&nbsp;Defenders</h3>
<p>This game helped keep my <span class="caps">LDR</span> alive. Fun and beginner-friendly up to a point,
then it&#8217;s suddenly punishingly difficult. We stopped at that&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>You need a friend to play this&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>Finished: basic&nbsp;campaign</p>
<p>Plan to replay: if the occasion&nbsp;arises</p>
<h3 id="frozen-synapse">Frozen&nbsp;Synapse</h3>
<p>Fascinating concept. A-minus&nbsp;execution.</p>
<p>Good if you like: turn-based&nbsp;tactics.</p>
<p>Finished: all but last level (no particular&nbsp;reason)</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="gone-home">Gone&nbsp;Home</h3>
<p>A touching story. That&#8217;s the&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, but once was definitely&nbsp;enough</p>
<h3 id="home">Home</h3>
<p>Creepy adventure game. Good for the experience, but quite unsatisfying on
several levels. I think the lack of satisfaction is also part of the
experience&#8230;but I don&#8217;t find that explanation&nbsp;satisfying.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="hotline-miami">Hotline&nbsp;Miami</h3>
<p>Violent. Mysterious.&nbsp;Awesome.</p>
<p>Good if you like: getting in&nbsp;fights</p>
<p>Finished: no (lost my&nbsp;momentum)</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p>
<h3 id="jamestown">Jamestown</h3>
<p>Fun shooter. I didn&#8217;t play much, but it&#8217;s well&nbsp;done.</p>
<h3 id="kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route&nbsp;Zero</h3>
<p>Dreamlike adventure game. Only 2 out of 5 episodes are out. I&#8217;ve finished&nbsp;both.</p>
<h3 id="limbo"><span class="caps">LIMBO</span></h3>
<p>Looks and feels great. I got worn out by constantly walking to the right and
never getting to the end. Lasted about 4 hours before I dropped it for more
interesting&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p>
<h3 id="lugaru-hd">Lugaru [<span class="caps">HD</span>]</h3>
<p>I think I enjoyed this so much because I was young. Now I&#8217;d need more of a
story or environment to stick with it. The mechanics are&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>Good if you like: getting in&nbsp;fights</p>
<p>Finished: no, but I sure played a&nbsp;lot</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, I&#8217;ll buy Overgrowth instead (same&nbsp;developer)</p>
<h3 id="lunar-flight">Lunar&nbsp;Flight</h3>
<p>Fly the Lunar Module on the moon. Heck yes! (I hope carrying cargo from A to B
is your idea of a good time. It certainly is for&nbsp;me.)</p>
<p>Finished: no, but 7 hours&nbsp;in</p>
<p>Plan to finish: maybe not, but a few more hours for&nbsp;sure</p>
<h3 id="machinarium">Machinarium</h3>
<p>Fun adventure game. I had to look up hints online a few times but generally
enjoyed&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="mark-of-the-ninja">Mark of the&nbsp;Ninja</h3>
<p>Nice stealth game. Great controller support. Performance issues on <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;X.</p>
<p>I only played 90 minutes, but I&#8217;ll probably get back to it&nbsp;later.</p>
<h3 id="minecraft-before-they-added-food">Minecraft before they added&nbsp;food</h3>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m a hipster. The current version is just bewildering to me. I just want
to explore&nbsp;caves!</p>
<h3 id="monaco">Monaco</h3>
<p>Conduct elaborate heists with&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p><strong>This game is so good,</strong> but you need friends to play it! The online community
is too&nbsp;inconsistent.</p>
<p>Finished: no (after 12&nbsp;hours)</p>
<p>Plan to finish: yes, if I can set up enough play&nbsp;dates</p>
<h3 id="penumbra-overture-black-plague-requiem">Penumbra (Overture, Black Plague,&nbsp;Requiem)</h3>
<p>Survival horror adventure. Evil Myst. These games were scary enough that I
haven&#8217;t yet conjured the nerve to play this studio&#8217;s next series,&nbsp;Amnesia.</p>
<p>Good if you like: soiled&nbsp;undergarments</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, once was&nbsp;plenty</p>
<h3 id="psychonauts">Psychonauts</h3>
<p>Fantastic story and world. Platforming sometimes finicky. Twice as long as you
expect, which is very&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>Good if you like: Tim Schafer dialogue, weird things&nbsp;happening</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay: maybe in five&nbsp;years</p>
<h3 id="shovel-knight">Shovel&nbsp;Knight</h3>
<p>Among the glut of polished indie platformers, this one stands out. I think of
it as Rogue Legacy with handmade levels. If I had the time for twitchy games,
I&#8217;d play more of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p>
<h3 id="solar-2">Solar&nbsp;2</h3>
<p>For once, a physics-based game I actually like! Utterly charming. The final
boss was hard enough that I never beat it, but it was a fun 6&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;almost</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p>
<h3 id="spacechem">SpaceChem</h3>
<p>For once, a puzzle game I actually like! Does a lot with a little. Exercises
your space-time reasoning very&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Finished: no, but 20 hours is pretty&nbsp;good</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="super-hexagon">Super&nbsp;Hexagon</h3>
<p>Punishingly difficult, but you will improve, because Super Hexagon will change
your&nbsp;brain.</p>
<p>Finished: doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;matter</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;yes</p>
<h3 id="the-swapper">The&nbsp;Swapper</h3>
<p>Mechanically simple puzzle platformer with stunning atmosphere, plot, and
visuals. The developers made very good choices about where to spend their&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, 3&nbsp;hours</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, once was&nbsp;enough</p>
<h3 id="sword-sworcery-ep">Sword <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sworcery <span class="caps">EP</span></h3>
<p>Dreamlike adventure game. The soundtrack makes&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Plan to replay: no, once was&nbsp;enough</p>
<h3 id="thomas-was-alone">Thomas Was&nbsp;Alone</h3>
<p>This is a platformer, but it&#8217;s also&nbsp;art.</p>
<p>Finished: yes,&nbsp;61m</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="trace-vector">Trace&nbsp;Vector</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for well-made retro arcade games. Trace Vector is simple,
original, and&nbsp;pretty.</p>
<p>Finished: no, but I&nbsp;will.</p>
<h3 id="the-walking-dead">The Walking&nbsp;Dead</h3>
<p>Entertaining casual adventure&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>Finished: yes, 21 hours for 5 episodes and <span class="caps">DLC</span></p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="world-of-goo">World of&nbsp;Goo</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s been a couple of years since I played through World of Goo, but I remember
it being utterly&nbsp;entertaining.</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p>
<p><a name="if-you-need-something-to-do"> </a></p>
<h2 id="if-you-need-something-to-do">If you need something to&nbsp;do</h2>
<p>(Get it in a&nbsp;bundle.)</p>
<h3 id="bittrip-beat"><span class="caps">BIT</span>.<span class="caps">TRIP</span> <span class="caps">BEAT</span></h3>
<p>Simplistic, entertaining. My mouse hand tends to drift because the X axis is&nbsp;ignored.</p>
<h3 id="blocks-that-matter">Blocks That&nbsp;Matter</h3>
<p>Puzzle platformers with weak stories and ho-hum mechanics are not my&nbsp;thing.</p>
<h3 id="cave-story">Cave&nbsp;Story</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s been too long since I played this. I stopped after 4-5 hours, don&#8217;t
remember why. It&#8217;s like a really good Gameboy&nbsp;game.</p>
<h3 id="edge"><span class="caps">EDGE</span></h3>
<p>Cute action-puzzle. I stopped playing it because I don&#8217;t like games that are
primarily skill challenges against a clock, particularly when they require
twitch reflexes. I&#8217;ll probably try again with a&nbsp;controller.</p>
<h3 id="fractal-make-blooms-not-war">Fractal: Make Blooms Not&nbsp;War</h3>
<p>Good for a twenty-minute mind-clearing. Simple and&nbsp;relaxing.</p>
<h3 id="gish">Gish</h3>
<p>Atmospheric and interesting platformer with okay mechanics. I probably put 3
hours into&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="gratuitous-space-battles">Gratuitous Space&nbsp;Battles</h3>
<p>Fun (I played about 5 hours) but shallow. I would enjoy this more if I was 12
(which is not an&nbsp;insult).</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="little-inferno">Little&nbsp;Inferno</h3>
<p>Pretty and pointless. That&#8217;s the&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>I internetted my way through it really quickly because I just wanted to see the
end without the boring game&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;ha.</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no.</p>
<h3 id="mcpixel">McPixel</h3>
<p>Have a few drinks and sit down with a friend. Play for twenty minutes. Giggle a
lot. Forget about it&nbsp;forever.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;no</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="organ-trail-directors-cut">Organ Trail: Director&#8217;s&nbsp;Cut</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty much what you&#8217;d think. Stylistically spot-on. Balanced enough to
keep me in it for 3 hours, but you really only need&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="osmos">Osmos</h3>
<p>Lovely way to pass the time on an&nbsp;iPad.</p>
<p>Finished:&nbsp;mostly</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;no</p>
<h3 id="papers-please">Papers,&nbsp;Please</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll finish this eventually. Glory to&nbsp;Arstotzka!</p>
<h3 id="proteus">Proteus</h3>
<p>Fun to walk around in for an hour (which is exactly what I did). Don&#8217;t be
afraid to look up a secret or two&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>Finished: more or&nbsp;less</p>
<p>Plan to replay:&nbsp;maybe</p>
<h3 id="revenge-of-the-titans">Revenge of the&nbsp;Titans</h3>
<p>Conventional tower defense. Not really my&nbsp;scene.</p>
<h3 id="voxatron">Voxatron</h3>
<p>Looked cool, but that didn&#8217;t translate to good gameplay. Jump and shoot, jump
and&nbsp;shoot.</p>
<h3 id="wizorb">Wizorb</h3>
<p>Arkanoid: The <span class="caps">RPG</span>. Another in the &#8220;really good Gameboy game&#8221;&nbsp;category.</p>
<h3 id="zen-bound-2">Zen Bound&nbsp;2</h3>
<p>Very physical-feeling puzzle game. Also very&nbsp;zen.</p>
<p><a name="insufficiently-entertaining"> </a></p>
<h2 id="insufficiently-entertaining">Insufficiently&nbsp;entertaining</h2>
<p>(I can see how other people would enjoy these&nbsp;games.)</p>
<h3 id="and-yet-it-moves">And Yet It&nbsp;Moves</h3>
<p>Bouncing ball is not compelling character. Physics engine is not compelling&nbsp;world.</p>
<h3 id="anodyne">Anodyne</h3>
<p>Seems like the story might be good, but combat is boring and the environments
are&nbsp;monotonous.</p>
<h3 id="bad-hotel">Bad&nbsp;Hotel</h3>
<p>I wanted to make a game like this once. Now I&#8217;m glad I&nbsp;didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>You make a tower of blocks which are guns or powerups. Stuff flies at you and
tries to knock it&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s more fun on a phone. I played it on a&nbsp;Mac.</p>
<h3 id="bittrip-core"><span class="caps">BIT</span>.<span class="caps">TRIP</span> <span class="caps">CORE</span></h3>
<p>Controller setup is bad and not configurable. (I hate D-pads.) Keyboard control
is awkward. As a fan of Super Hexagon, I can see myself getting into this a lot
for a week or two, but without good controls I&nbsp;can&#8217;t.</p>
<h3 id="the-bridge">The&nbsp;Bridge</h3>
<p>The art style is interesting, but it&#8217;s slow and lacks variety in gameplay or&nbsp;graphics.</p>
<h3 id="broken-sword-1-shadow-of-the-templars">Broken Sword 1: Shadow of the&nbsp;Templars</h3>
<p>Bad voice acting. Inconsistent art. Mediocre puzzle&nbsp;design.</p>
<h3 id="brutal-legend">Brütal&nbsp;Legend</h3>
<p>I want to like it, but it just runs so badly on <span class="caps">OS</span> X. Pretty bewildering
<span class="caps">UI</span>/control-wise for the first hour as&nbsp;well.</p>
<h3 id="dungeons-of-dredmor">Dungeons of&nbsp;Dredmor</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember it being <em>bad</em>, but I was not sufficiently entertained. There
are better&nbsp;roguelikes.</p>
<h3 id="dustforce">Dustforce</h3>
<p>So-so platformer with the thinnest veil of a&nbsp;story.</p>
<h3 id="dynamite-jack">Dynamite&nbsp;Jack</h3>
<p>I was bored after 15&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<h3 id="electronic-super-joy">Electronic Super&nbsp;Joy</h3>
<p>Fast action platformer. The &#8220;Aaaah!&#8221;s got old so fast that I stopped playing
after 15 minutes. I&#8217;ll probably try again to see if it gets interesting, but
it&#8217;s generally a sensory&nbsp;overload.</p>
<h3 id="english-country-tune">English Country&nbsp;Tune</h3>
<p>Spatial decision tree puzzles. Graphics are very basic. Bored after 15&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<h3 id="escape-velocity-original-override-nova">Escape Velocity (original, Override,&nbsp;Nova)</h3>
<p>I played these games collectively for probably 200 hours, so what are they
doing in here? They don&#8217;t stand the test of time. They are boring and
unbalanced by today&#8217;s space combat&nbsp;standards.</p>
<p>But making mods was amazing and fun, and why I learned so much about resource
forks in Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> ≤&nbsp;9.</p>
<p>Despite my complaints about its dated combat, I haven&#8217;t yet found a game that
has the same kind of slow-paced space fight and enormous story. There&#8217;s room
for a game like that today, but it would probably need to have better <span class="caps">AI</span> and be
in&nbsp;3D.</p>
<h3 id="hack-slash-loot">Hack, Slash,&nbsp;Loot</h3>
<p>Combat, story, and graphics all too simplistic. Baby&#8217;s First Roguelike. I am
not a&nbsp;baby.</p>
<h3 id="hammerfight">Hammerfight</h3>
<p>I have made games like this before. None of them were good. They start with a
programmer saying &#8220;let&#8217;s take the physics engine hand have the player swing
stuff around.&#8221; It&#8217;s only fun if you programmed&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="incredipede">Incredipede</h3>
<p>Another frustrating physics game without much in the way of story. Looks pretty&nbsp;though.</p>
<h3 id="legend-of-dungeon">Legend of&nbsp;Dungeon</h3>
<p>Mediocre &#8220;early access&#8221; toy. Bad controls and bad <span class="caps">UI</span>. Try again in two&nbsp;years.</p>
<h3 id="legend-of-grimrock">Legend of&nbsp;Grimrock</h3>
<p>Monotonous. There are better&nbsp;roguelikes.</p>
<p><em>After reading reviews of Grimrock, I&#8217;m convinced I should give it another&nbsp;shot.</em></p>
<h3 id="rochard">Rochard</h3>
<p>Fun for a while, but the mechanics are pretty&nbsp;shallow.</p>
<h3 id="space-pirates-and-zombies">Space Pirates And&nbsp;Zombies</h3>
<p>Bad tutorial, ugly&nbsp;graphics.</p>
<h3 id="splice">Splice</h3>
<p>The most basic decision tree puzzles&nbsp;imaginable.</p>
<h3 id="stacking">Stacking</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch old movies. It&#8217;s less fun to do a thousand fetch&nbsp;quests.</p>
<h3 id="uplink">Uplink</h3>
<p>I got really into this for a couple of weeks in high school, but when I picked
it up again last year it was boring and&nbsp;tedious.</p>
<h3 id="vvvvv"><span class="caps">VVVVV</span></h3>
<p>Good platformer, but I want more than just good&nbsp;platforming.</p>
<p><a name="avoid"> </a></p>
<h2 id="avoid">Avoid</h2>
<h3 id="bittrip-fate"><span class="caps">BIT</span>.<span class="caps">TRIP</span> <span class="caps">FATE</span></h3>
<p>Confusing, bizarre, unsatisfying. Nothing to do with&nbsp;rhythm.</p>
<h3 id="shank">Shank</h3>
<p>Good fighting mechanics ruined by misogynist&nbsp;drivel.</p>
<h3 id="super-meat-boy-on-os-x">Super Meat Boy on <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;X</h3>
<p>I realize you might kill me for this. But the truth is, the Mac port is awful.
No fullscreen, no controller configuration, crashes,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<h3 id="worms-reloaded-on-os-x">Worms Reloaded on <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;X</h3>
<p>Bad port is&nbsp;bad.</p>
