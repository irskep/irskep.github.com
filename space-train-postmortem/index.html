    <div class="entry-content hyphenate"><p>With the end of a semester just past, my course projects are all bubbling up in
various states of completion. One of these is a point-and-click adventure game
called <em><a href="http:/www.steveasleep.com/spacetrain">Space Train: Terror on the Mustachio
Express</a></em>, developed by a team of
students from the <a href="http:/www.cia.edu/">Cleveland Institute of Art</a> and <a href="http:/www.case.edu">Case
Western Reserve University</a>. Its technical components
include an event-driven level scripting system, characters, items, inventory,
dialogue, and more.  The engine is written in Python using my game programming
weapon of choice, the <a href="http:/www.pyglet.org">pyglet</a> library. The&nbsp;plot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inga Borga is a poetry-loving senior citizen. One of her favorite authors,
Stanislov Slavinsky, is reading his poetry live on the nearby Planet Deux, a
short hop by space train from Inga&#8217;s home. She wants nothing more than to see
Stanislav in person, so she catches the Mustachio Express to Planet Deux.
Little does she know it will be a bumpy&nbsp;ride&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds grand, right? We thought so too, but in typical student fashion we
failed to account for one thing: <strong>adventure games take a lot of work to
make.</strong> As a result, the game is only about twenty minutes long. Even so, we
all learned from the&nbsp;experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-course">The&nbsp;Course</h2>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span><span class="caps">EECS</span> 390 - Advanced Game Development Project&#8221; is a joint course between the
Cleveland Institute of Art and Case Western Reserve University. Teams of 6-12
artists and programmers collaborate to produce some sort of game. At the end of
the course, the teams present to their peers and to Electronic Arts staff for
questions and critique. The course is currently taught by Dr. Marc Buchner
(<span class="caps">CWRU</span>) and <a href="http:/www.knuthybinette.com/">Knut Hybinette</a>&nbsp;(<span class="caps">CIA</span>).</p>
<p>The other two games made this semester were Kalotai, a location-aware monster
collection/battle game for Android, and Louder Than Words, a platformer with
branching story lines based on a morality&nbsp;system.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-went-down">How It Went&nbsp;Down</h2>
<p>We all arrived at 8:30 <span class="caps">AM</span> on the first day of class, heavily caffeinated.
Everyone put ideas on a white board and then divided into three teams based on
interest. My team ended up with four programmers and six artists, with me as
team leader. We immediately decided on some basics and began working on a
schedule. By 9:45, we had drawn a crazy whiteboard&nbsp;diagram.</p>
<p>It was already clear that we would make the best game ever. The drawing was so
good we didn&#8217;t even need a design document. We wrote one anyway because it was
a course requirement. We spent the next month and a half developing the
environments and the characters, fleshing out plot points, and writing the game&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>The class was only scheduled to meet for an hour every week, which was far from
enough time to get anything done. Most of our communication was done on Fridays
in a classroom when we met to give status updates, brainstorm new directions,
and work on the schedule. During the week, we communicated via a mailing list,
shared files using a <a href="http:/www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> shared folder, and
pushed code back and forth with <a href="http:/www.git-scm.org/">git</a></p>
<p>At the halfway point, we presented our work to the class. Our demo revealed
some significant issues, none of which were technical: the character art lacked
a consistent style, the story was not cohesive, and there were no clear puzzle
designs. The characters we did have were shallow and stereotyped. This was not
a good situation to be in for a story-based and art-heavy&nbsp;game!</p>
<p>We immediately changed our art and story development processes. Rather than
have three or four artists take characters all the way from concept to final
execution, we split all character work into line work, coloring, and shading,
and assigned one artist to each stage of the pipeline. Rather than working from
a vague, error-prone shared idea of a partially-recorded story, I spent a few
hours writing detailed scripts for each level we planned to implement. We
followed this process to the end, and it worked beautifully. We had a very
slick&nbsp;demo.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the&nbsp;game:</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons&nbsp;Learned</h2>
<p>I had never been in a managerial position before. My experience organizing
<a href="http:/hacsoc.org/"><span class="caps">CWRU</span> Hacker Society</a> helped, but that was more cat herding
than game building. By the end of the course the team had worked out a process
by trial and error that seemed to produce results, but by the time we found
that process, it was really too late to save the&nbsp;game.</p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<p>We spent too much time thinking up random characters and not enough time
fitting them into a big picture. We should have started writing
pseudo-screenplays or storyboards to work from by the third week. That would
have made it easier for us to give the artists specific tasks, a problem we had
early&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Storyboards would have given us the opportunity to implement parts of the
levels, which would have helped us develop a scripting <span class="caps">API</span>. For most of the
semester, we worked with an ad-hoc <span class="caps">API</span>. We ended up redesigning it in the last
week because it wasn&#8217;t working for us&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<h3 id="adventure-games-are-hard-to-make">Adventure Games Are Hard to&nbsp;Make</h3>
<p>Almost every game I have ever made has involved bullets. That usually means
those bullets are heading for a relatively small number of enemy types, are
flying over relatively simple pre-rendered or procedurally generated terrain,
and have very simple animations. In an adventure game, everything the player
sees has a unique design and multiple animations. The average screen time of a
given image is minutes or less. Even though we were working with six artists,
we were barely able to finish our 20 minutes of play&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3 id="communication-is-key">Communication is&nbsp;Key</h3>
<p>We encouraged communication by providing as many useful collaboration tools as
possible. Without constant communication, Space Train would have been a total&nbsp;failure.</p>
<p>By keeping all live game assets in a shared Dropbox folder, we guaranteed
instant availability of the artists&#8217; work without using a cumbersome email
system or an artist-unfriendly version control system. Our consistent meeting
format was usually effective at giving everyone concrete goals for the week.
Git, of course, is the ideal code collaboration tool. The mailing list filled
in any&nbsp;gaps.</p>
<h3 id="course-project-group-dynamics-are-weird">Course Project Group Dynamics are&nbsp;Weird</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve always felt uncomfortable with the way course project groups are formed.
Usually they form around ideas, not around teams, and that was explicitly the
case with this course. This means that team dynamics are a total crapshoot, and
if things go south, you&#8217;re locked in for three months and your success is
irrevocably chained together. By the end of the course, we effectively had two
programmers and four artists, with four other people functioning as dead&nbsp;weight.</p>
<h3 id="conspicuously-absent-from-this-list">Conspicuously Absent From This&nbsp;List:</h3>
<p>Significant code issues. We really powered through the engine and never got
hindered by any major design flaws. The game&#8217;s source code is <a href="http:/www.github.com/irskep/Space-Train">on
Github</a>. It&#8217;s not beautiful, but it
worked well enough for&nbsp;us.</p>
