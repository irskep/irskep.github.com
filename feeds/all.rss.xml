&lt;p&gt;This year I participated in &lt;a href="https://ldjam.com"&gt;Ludum Dare 38&lt;/a&gt;, a 48-hour game programming &amp;#8220;competition.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about trying my hand at a roguelike for a while now, and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to give it a shot. I made &lt;a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/rogue-basement"&gt;Rogue Basement&lt;/a&gt;, a bare-bones, single-level game with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;#8217;ll cover the game design decisions I made, how they affect the player&amp;#8217;s experience, and a bit of how they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/rogue_basement/screenshot2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-is-a-roguelike"&gt;What is a&amp;nbsp;roguelike?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;#8220;roguelike&amp;#8221; is a game that is &amp;#8220;like Rogue,&amp;#8221; a text-based game from the 1980s that looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rogue_Screen_Shot_CAR.png" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/rogue_basement/257BD0D6AB2E10E523C6F74028CBC005.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical features of these games&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procedurally generated&amp;nbsp;levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permadeath (one&amp;nbsp;life)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn-based&amp;nbsp;action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-down 2D graphics, often just&amp;nbsp;text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulation-oriented; interesting stories arise from the game&amp;#8217;s rules and&amp;nbsp;behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very difficult to win without lots of&amp;nbsp;practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of these features makes the games fun to play over and over again. You have to play a lot to get good, but since the game is procedurally generated, you&amp;#8217;re always facing new situations. You have to use your wits to&amp;nbsp;survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="environment"&gt;Environment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started on Friday night with a level generator. When you&amp;#8217;re time-constrained, you have to make very careful decisions about where to innovate, and I chose to stick to a roguelike trope for my basic layout: boxy rooms connected by narrow corridors, with doors where corridors meet&amp;nbsp;rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have placed a bunch of rooms randomly and made sure each one was connected to another, but it&amp;#8217;s tricky to use space efficiently that way. A common way to avoid this problem is to use a &lt;strong&gt;binary space partitioning&amp;nbsp;tree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea here is that you take a rectangular area, like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+----------------------------------------+
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
|                                        |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Divide it along the X or Y axis at a random point, like this, and label each&amp;nbsp;side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+----------------------------------------+
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
|       a         |          b           |
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Within each side, divide again on the other axis at a random&amp;nbsp;point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+----------------------------------------+
|                 |                      |
|       aa        |         ba           |
|                 |                      |
|-----------------|                      |
|                 |                      |
|                 |----------------------|
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
|       ab        |         bb           |
|                 |                      |
|                 |                      |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Divide some&amp;nbsp;more&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+----------------------------------------+
|       |         |              |       |
|  aaa  |   aab   |     baa      |  bab  |
|       |         |              |       |
|-----------------|              |       |
|          |      |              |       |
|          |      |----------------------|
|          |      |       |              |
|   aba    | abb  |       |              |
|          |      |  bba  |     bbb      |
|          |      |       |              |
|          |      |       |              |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When the cells get too small, stop dividing. Inside each cell, decide how to use the space. The most basic strategy is to just completely fill each cell. Here&amp;#8217;s a screenshot I took when I got to this&amp;nbsp;point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-21 21.00.42.png" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/rogue_basement/F883885B86DCA6D8BD0F58083AB16166.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s more interesting to mix it up with different sizes of&amp;nbsp;rectangles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+----------------------------------------+
| +--+  | +------+|   +------+   |       |
| |  |  | |      ||   |      |   |+-----+|
| +--+  | +------+|   |      |   ||     ||
|-----------------|   |      |   ||     ||
|          |+--+  |   +------+   |+-----+|
|          ||  |  |----------------------|
|   +----+ ||  |  |+-----+|              |
|   |    | ||  |  ||     ||+-----+       |
|   |    | |+--+  ||     |||     |       |
|   +----+ |      ||     |||     |       |
|          |      |+-----+|+-----+       |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You probably noticed I annotated all the cells with &lt;code&gt;aab&lt;/code&gt; and such. We&amp;#8217;ll use that information to add corridors. For every pair of areas that share the first 2 letters of their identifier (&amp;#8220;siblings in the tree&amp;#8221;), we add an L-shaped corridor from a random point in one to a random point in the other. If a point is already inside a room, we&amp;#8217;ll leave it alone. If a point is on a wall, we&amp;#8217;ll turn it into a&amp;nbsp;door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+----------------------------------------+
| +--+    +------+|   +------+           |
| |  &amp;#39;####&amp;#39;      ||   |      |    +-----+|
| +--+    +------+|   |      &amp;#39;####&amp;#39;     ||
|-----------------|   |      |    |     ||
|           +--+  |   +------+    +-----+|
|     ######&amp;#39;  |  |----------------------|
|   +-&amp;#39;--+  |  |  |+-----+               |
|   |    |  |  |  ||     | +-----+       |
|   |    |  +--+  ||     &amp;#39;#&amp;#39;     |       |
|   +----+        ||     | |     |       |
|                 |+-----+ +-----+       |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we do it again, but the random point in each section will come from a random room in each respective&amp;nbsp;section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+----------------------------------------+
| +--+    +------+|   +------+           |
| |  &amp;#39;####&amp;#39;      ||   |      |    +-----+|
| +--+    +&amp;#39;-----+|   |      &amp;#39;####&amp;#39;     ||
|          #      |   |      |    |     ||
|          #+--+  |   +-&amp;#39;----+    +-----+|
|     ######&amp;#39;  |  |     #                |
|   +-&amp;#39;--+ #|  |  |+----&amp;#39;+               |
|   |    | #|  |  ||     | +-----+       |
|   |    +##+--+  ||     &amp;#39;#&amp;#39;     |       |
|   +----+        ||     | |     |       |
|                 |+-----+ +-----+       |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And finally we&amp;#8217;ll do it again to the top-level&amp;nbsp;pair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+----------------------------------------+
| +--+    +------+    +------+           |
| |  &amp;#39;####&amp;#39;      &amp;#39;#   |      |    +-----+|
| +--+    +&amp;#39;-----+#   |      &amp;#39;####&amp;#39;     ||
|          #      #   |      |    |     ||
|          #+--+  #   +-&amp;#39;----+    +-----+|
|     ######&amp;#39;  |  #     #                |
|   +-&amp;#39;--+ #|  |  #+----&amp;#39;+               |
|   |    | #|  |  #|     | +-----+       |
|   |    +##+--+  #&amp;#39;     &amp;#39;#&amp;#39;     |       |
|   +----+         |     | |     |       |
|                  +-----+ +-----+       |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s how it looked during&amp;nbsp;development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-21 21.50.39.png" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/rogue_basement/B74AF325D250255EA7B86A64BE1AAFD0.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a few&amp;nbsp;guarantees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All rooms are reachable from all other&amp;nbsp;rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No rooms&amp;nbsp;intersect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a given pair of room groups (everything under &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; vs everything under &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, for example), there is exactly one path between&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last point has some good and bad ramifications. On the bad side, it worsens replayability, because the corridors are roughly organized the same way from game to game. I noticed this while playtesting; after 3 games it&amp;#8217;s obvious that the rooms generally have the same&amp;nbsp;layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those characteristics allowed me to take a simple approach to matching the theme of Ludum Dare 38: &amp;#8220;A Small World.&amp;#8221; The first two splits don&amp;#8217;t have to be random; if they always split the sections evenly, then the map will have 4 even quadrants. I used this to create 4 distinct areas of increasing difficulty, so I could have a &amp;#8220;one-level roguelike&amp;#8221; with some actual&amp;nbsp;progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I split up the map like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;+-------------------+--------------------+
|                   |                    |
|                   |                    |
|         aa        |         ba         |
|    (start here)   |     (end here)     |
|         |         |         ^          |
|---------|---------+---------|----------|
|         v         |         |          |
|                   |                    |
|         ab     -------&amp;gt;     bb         |
|                   |                    |
|                   |                    |
+----------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The player starts in &lt;code&gt;aa&lt;/code&gt; and moves to &lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;bb&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;ba&lt;/code&gt;, where the goal&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s another map from early development, which splits the map in this&amp;nbsp;way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-22 10.54.30.png" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/rogue_basement/2EE2A79C08555276A852AAEA4DBEA9C7.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s one with just the first two partition lines, so you can see how the map is&amp;nbsp;divided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-22 10.56.58.png" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/rogue_basement/6F0FA752B4F575565A46B67ABF9120B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, here are the hallways that mark the transitions between each&amp;nbsp;section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-22 11.40.44.png" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/rogue_basement/360C018F2FCC756A1A59049EB36E67AA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally the colors were just for debugging, but I ended up leaving them in place because they signal&amp;nbsp;specialness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add variety, I created a &lt;code&gt;rooms.csv&lt;/code&gt; file to define a few room&amp;nbsp;types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                                      Monster   Item
Shape,      Difficulty, Monsters,   Chance, Color,    Density,  Density
box_random, 0.00,       *,          1.00,   #666666,  5.00,     5.00
box_random, 1.00,       *,          1.00,   #886666,  5.00,     4.00
box_random, 2.00,       *,          1.00,   #668866,  5.00,     3.00
box_random, 3.00,       *,          1.00,   #886688,  5.00,     2.00
box_full,   *,          verp_1      0.20,   #6666ff,  2.00,     4.00
                          |verp_2
                          |verp_3
                          |verp_4,
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So within each quadrant, there is an 80% chance a room will have shape &lt;code&gt;box_random&lt;/code&gt;, a quadrant-specific color, 5 monsters per 100 tiles, 5 items per 100 tiles, and allow any area-appropriate monster. But there is a 20% chance that the room will have the shape &lt;code&gt;box_full&lt;/code&gt; (fill its entire &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSP&lt;/span&gt; tree cell) and contain only verps, 2 per 100&amp;nbsp;tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="inhabitants"&gt;Inhabitants&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-player"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first inhabitant of the world is the player, represented by an &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; (because the cell with the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; is &amp;#8220;where you are at&amp;#8221;). All world inhabitants, henceforth called &amp;#8220;monsters&amp;#8221; (after all, humans are the real monsters) and defined in &lt;code&gt;monsters.csv&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;id,     Char, Color,    Difficulty, Chance, Behaviors,          hp_max, strength, items
player, @,    #ffffff,  -1,         0.00,   keyboard_movement,  100,    5.00,
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Difficulty&amp;#8221; determines which quadrant a monster can spawn in. The player is a special case, so the level generator ignores it. The player moves in response to keyboard events, has 100 hit points, and hits other monsters for 5 damage. (The combat system in Rogue Basement is not sophisticated. There is no randomness. Remember, I had to be careful about where to spend&amp;nbsp;innovation-points!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="npcs"&gt;NPCs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, NPCs (non-player characters) in video games and tabletop RPGs are differentiated based on three important&amp;nbsp;things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What they can&amp;nbsp;do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How they&amp;nbsp;behave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many hits they take to kill, depending on what the player can&amp;nbsp;do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those things affect the player&amp;#8217;s behavior, strategy, and tactics. For a time-constrained game like Rogue Basement, I wanted to stick to the absolute&amp;nbsp;basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monsters are all defined in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; file (&lt;code&gt;monsters.csv&lt;/code&gt;). The very first monster I added was &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;verp&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;id,     Char, Color,    Difficulty, Chance, Behaviors,          hp_max, strength, items
verp,   v,    #ffff00,  0.00,       1.00,   beeline_visible,    10,     2.00,
                                            |random_walk
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In human terms, that definition reads as: &amp;#8220;The &amp;#8216;verp&amp;#8217; monster, represented by a yellow &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;, appears in difficulty-zero rooms (first quadrant) with a random weight of 1.0, moves randomly unless it sees the player in which case it moves toward them, has 10 hit points, does 2 damage to the player when hitting, and has no items at the game&amp;nbsp;start.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviors are implemented as Python classes. After the player moves, each monster has a chance to move as well. Behaviors can be stacked, meaning that if one behavior decides it can&amp;#8217;t do anything, control can be passed to the next behavior in the list. So the verp&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;beeline_visible&lt;/code&gt; behavior either says &amp;#8220;I see the player, I move toward them&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I do not see the player, let some other behavior act this&amp;nbsp;turn.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adding the verps, I wanted to balance them out with a monster that attacks from a distance. I started by defining a behavior &lt;code&gt;range_5_visible&lt;/code&gt; which acts like &lt;code&gt;beeline_visible&lt;/code&gt;, but instead of trying to move onto the player&amp;#8217;s space, the monster tries to be exactly 5 tiles away. If the player approaches the monster, it will run away unless it is backed into a&amp;nbsp;corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attached this behavior to a new enemy type, the &lt;code&gt;wibble&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;). But a monster that only runs away isn&amp;#8217;t very challenging! So it was time to deepen the simulation by adding&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items have simple&amp;nbsp;characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monsters (including the player) can hold them in an unlimited&amp;nbsp;inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a monster dies, its items are dropped on the&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only had time to add one kind of item: the rock (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;). The rock has one use: you can throw it. When you do, the game spawns a new enemy with this&amp;nbsp;definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;id,             Char, Color,    Difficulty, Chance, Behaviors,        hp_max, strength, items
rock_in_flight, *,    #c1a073,  -1,         0,      path_until_hit,   2,      2,
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since its &amp;#8220;difficulty&amp;#8221; is -1, it never spawns in the initial level. Its only behavior is to move along a path until it hits a wall, a monster, or the player. It has 2 hit&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a special item, so the game ignores the &lt;code&gt;strength&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; attributes in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; file. Instead, the &lt;code&gt;rock_in_flight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;s strength value is taken from &lt;em&gt;the monster that threw the rock&lt;/em&gt;, and the original rock item is added to the &lt;code&gt;rock_in_flight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;s inventory! When the &lt;code&gt;rock_in_flight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;s &lt;code&gt;path_until_hit&lt;/code&gt; behavior detects that its life is over, the &lt;code&gt;rock_in_flight&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;dies&amp;#8221; and the contents of its inventory (the &lt;code&gt;rock&lt;/code&gt;) are dropped on the&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I had throwable rocks, I could put a couple in each &lt;code&gt;wibble&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;s inventory and give them the ability to throw them. The &lt;code&gt;wibble&lt;/code&gt; definition looked like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;id,     Char, Color,    Difficulty, Chance, Behaviors,          hp_max, strength, items
wibble, w,    #90582c,  0.00,       20,     range_5_visible     10,     2,        ROCKx1
                                              |throw_rock_slow
                                              |sleep,
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I added a &amp;#8220;sleep&amp;#8221; behavior to differentiate wibbles from verps. When the player isn&amp;#8217;t around, verps are hyperactive and run around randomly; wibbles sit and meditate. It seemed in keeping with their fighting&amp;nbsp;styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all worked great, but when wibbles ran out of rocks, the game got really easy! So I added another behavior, &lt;code&gt;pick_up_rocks&lt;/code&gt;, which makes a wibble either move toward any adjacent rocks, or pick them up if it&amp;#8217;s standing on&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;conservation of rocks&amp;#8221; principle introduces a new tactic into the game: players can pick up all the rocks to deprive the wibbles of their ammunition. Fortunately the player&amp;#8217;s backpack is infinitely&amp;nbsp;large!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stun-effect"&gt;Stun&amp;nbsp;effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, combat consisted of punching verps and dodging or punching rocks. (Yeah, you can punch rocks! They are just monsters after all!) I wanted to make it possible to avoid almost all damage, though, by understanding the game&amp;#8217;s systems, and the verps made it too hard to do that by being&amp;nbsp;relentless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made every hit by the player stun the target monster for 2 turns. This is done using a behavior called &lt;code&gt;stunnable&lt;/code&gt;, which just says &amp;#8220;if I&amp;#8217;ve been hit within the last 2 turns, turn blue and do&amp;nbsp;nothing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For experienced roguelike players this makes the game easy once you figure it out, but I believe it&amp;#8217;s still a rewarding experience to figure it out in the first place. It is very, very difficult to make a game by yourself in 48 hours that has more than a few minutes of worthwhile gameplay, so I was aiming to just make those few minutes as good as possible and then let players feel like they could put it down after a good&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="healing"&gt;Healing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make each section its own challenge, I decided to have the colored hallways between sections heal the player completely. This is another difficulty decrease that I could probably have left out, but I decided to err on the side of easy because I knew I had some user interface issues and wanted to be &amp;#8220;extra&amp;#8221; fair to&amp;nbsp;players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="unintended-consequences"&gt;Unintended&amp;nbsp;consequences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simulation has a few features I didn&amp;#8217;t intend, but that I don&amp;#8217;t regretâthat&amp;#8217;s half the&amp;nbsp;fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features mainly have to do with rocks, and the fact that when you throw them, they become monsters.&amp;nbsp;Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can punch rocks out of the&amp;nbsp;air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you throw a rock, and then walk in its direction, you will punch it dead before it has a chance to&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If two wibbles throw rocks at you at the same time, they may collide in midair and&amp;nbsp;die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can embed rocks in walls. (Okay, not so happy about this&amp;nbsp;one.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="atmosphere"&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="music"&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took 90 minutes to write 4 tracks, adding up to 11 minutes of music. Each map quadrant plays one of the tracks. &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/irskep/sets/rogue-basement-ost"&gt;You can listen to them&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music fades down when you&amp;#8217;re in a colored hallway and fades up again when you enter a room in a map quadrant. My intention is to build tension and give the player a clue, in addition to the different colors, that the monsters are about to get&amp;nbsp;tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="title-screen"&gt;Title&amp;nbsp;screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this adorable title screen, and reused the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; art in the&amp;nbsp;manual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="title screen" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/rogue_basement/screenshot1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="takeaways"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="scope"&gt;Scope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features I had planned to add but&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#8217;t:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple basements and an&amp;nbsp;overworld&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health&amp;nbsp;potions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire/ice&amp;nbsp;missiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 more enemy types to use those&amp;nbsp;missiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From past experience, I knew that scope was always a problem, so I tackled the highest-priority mechanics first, which means I ended up with a real game instead of a tech&amp;nbsp;demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="difficulty-is-hard"&gt;Difficulty is&amp;nbsp;hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s very difficult to tune for difficulty without time to playtest and fix things! I kept making the game easier because developers almost always make games too hard on the first pass, and I wanted to overcompensate to make it more likely that people would finish it in one&amp;nbsp;sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback so far seems to indicate that the difficulty is just about right. No one says it&amp;#8217;s too hard, and some people say they&amp;#8217;ve been playing for 25 minutes(!!!) and haven&amp;#8217;t beaten it&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="csvs-and-roguelikes-are-best-friends"&gt;CSVs and roguelikes are best&amp;nbsp;friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I moved some data out of Python code into a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; file, it got 10x easier to add new content, but not for the reason you might thing. Yes, copy/pasting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; rows is an easy way to add new things, but the act of &lt;em&gt;designing&lt;/em&gt; the file format made me think about how the whole program worked and put flexible systems in place that would let me do more cool stuff&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already see the limitations of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;, so I think next I&amp;#8217;m going to switch to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;, but with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt; values for each column. I really like the efficiency of editing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s not flexible enough to do what I&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="preparation-matters"&gt;Preparation&amp;nbsp;matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week before Ludum Dare 38, I worked on an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; user interface and roguelike development framework. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to spend a bunch of time making a crappy title screen, I wanted to focus on gameplay! By writing and releasing the framework, I had all the relevant APIs in memory as soon as the competition started, and I could get going immediately on the important&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="music-makes-a-difference"&gt;Music makes a&amp;nbsp;difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music is really simple, but it adds a huge amount of atmosphere and is a strong signal of progression. It was time well spent, especially since when I made it (the middle of the night) my programmer brain wasn&amp;#8217;t working anymore. Most of the positive reviews mention the music, so I think it will affect my score even outside the Audio&amp;nbsp;category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ascii-is-a-ludum-dare-graphics-cheat-code"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; is a Ludum Dare graphics cheat&amp;nbsp;code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; is traditional for roguelikes, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s going to cost me too many points in the Graphics category. I&amp;#8217;ve always had a difficult time making nice-looking graphics, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; means it&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="making-videos-ameliorates-loneliness"&gt;Making videos ameliorates&amp;nbsp;loneliness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I felt like I hit a milestone, I did a quick &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzdytAQSpVhUCVgJvtgDNEQ2DI41KiKr"&gt;video update&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;#8217;t really expect anyone to watch them, but it helped give me perspective on my progress. And it simulated human interaction a little bit, which was nice because I was alone in the house for the entire&amp;nbsp;weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most fun game I have ever made, and the most fun I have ever had making a game. Thanks for reading! You can watch all this happen at super-speed in this timelapse&amp;nbsp;video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jo8d34N3tdY?list=PLuzdytAQSpVhUCVgJvtgDNEQ2DI41KiKr" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Steve Johnson</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:steveasleep.com,2017-05-04:the-design-and-implementation-of-rogue-basement.html</guid><category>games</category></item><item><title>Home audio with OS X and cheap consumerÂ electronics</title><link>http://steveasleep.com/home-audio-with-os-x-and-cheap-consumer-electronics.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Since moving into our current house, Casey and I have been trying to make our living room audio setup seamless. This is a silly story with a lot of unnecessary detail about my adventures and choices in home audio&amp;nbsp;setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-wish-list"&gt;The wish&amp;nbsp;list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is our primary focus. We have no need to switch video. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCA&lt;/span&gt; and 3.5mm cables are the norm, not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDMI&lt;/span&gt;. This doesnât prevent us from getting a receiver that supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCA&lt;/span&gt;, but those tend to be bulky and have lots of&amp;nbsp;buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share a large &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; library that we would both like to control. Itâs easy enough to take turns plugging our computers or phones into an aux cable, but itâs so much more seamless to collaboratively queue things up in the same player. Thereâs a mix of Windows and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X machines in the house, so the solution has to be&amp;nbsp;multi-platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; that functions as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and gaming machine. Latency is important for that use case, so wifi is&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of gaming, it would be nice to be able to hear two audio sources at a time. I often disable game soundtracks and play my own&amp;nbsp;tunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people come stay with us, I want to be able to explain how it all works in less than 120&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I shouldnât need to mess with it constantly. It should do everything we need without crashing or&amp;nbsp;fiddling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve tried a bunch of low-cost configurations, and this is what we have today. Itâs reliable, predictable, and hits all the points&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mac-as-media-server"&gt;Mac as media&amp;nbsp;server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an old Mac laptop from 2011. Hereâs how I set it up to act as a media server and audio passthrough device. Note that I already have an amplifier for the speakers. If you donât, well, maybe youâre better off with a regular receiver! Anyway, on to&amp;nbsp;setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find an out-of-the-way location. Plug the laptop into the speakers and power. Weâre about to set things up so you donât need to be physically at the computer to manage it, so donât worry about the location being convenient to&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="initial-setup-seated-at-media-server"&gt;Initial setup (seated at media&amp;nbsp;server)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open System Preferences. Select Sharing. Check the âRemote Managementâ box, and when the drop-down opens, select âObserveâ and&amp;nbsp;âControl.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sharing preference pane" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/home_audio_adventures/prefpane_sharing.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set or remember the âComputer Nameâ field at the top. A nice, short name you could use would be &lt;code&gt;media-server&lt;/code&gt;. Going forward, Iâm going to assume you used that&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in System Preferences, click the back button. Go to âUsers &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Groupsâ. Click âLogin Options.â Make sure the âAutomatic login:â menu is set to the user you want. (You may also need to go to âSecurity &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Privacyâ in System Preferences and uncheck âDisable automatic&amp;nbsp;login.â)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href="http://semaja2.net/projects/insomniaxinfo/"&gt;InsomniaX&lt;/a&gt; if youâre using a laptop. This will let you close the lid without putting the laptop to sleep. Once installed and running, open the menu, and make sure Preferences &amp;gt; âStart on Loginâ is&amp;nbsp;checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now close the lid and head to another Mac so you can configure things more&amp;nbsp;comfortably!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="remaining-setup-remote"&gt;Remaining setup&amp;nbsp;(remote)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mac number two, open a Finder window. In the Finder menu bar, select Go &amp;gt; Network or hit Command+Shift+K. Pick &lt;code&gt;media-server&lt;/code&gt; from the list and click the Share Screen button. Enter your username and password for your account on the media&amp;nbsp;server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see a list with &lt;code&gt;media-server&lt;/code&gt; init. Click it. There should be a âShare Screenâ¦â button. Click it. Enter your username and password from &lt;code&gt;media-server&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Network folder in Finder" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/home_audio_adventures/finder_network.png" /&gt;
ï¿¼
(I call mine&amp;nbsp;âfiona.â)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you really get going, you might want to take some time to open your wifi routerâs settings and assign a dedicated internal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; to the media server. Macs will be able to connect to it as &lt;code&gt;media-server.local&lt;/code&gt;, but Windows machines wonât. I wonât provide specific instructions here due to the infinite variety of router software, but it was pretty simple on my Airport&amp;nbsp;Extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here there are a ton of things you can do, so Iâll organize the rest of this post by&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spotify"&gt;Spotify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify is easy to set up but limited to one user. Install Spotify on the media server, sign in to it, and ask it to launch itself on login. (Menu -&amp;gt; Spotify -&amp;gt; Preferences, Show Advanced Settings, Open Spotify automatically after you log in to the&amp;nbsp;computer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your devices can now control Spotify on the media server, but you have to be logged in as you. Even with family sharing, thereâs no way to share a device among multiple user accounts without going for a super-technical solution like &lt;a href="https://github.com/dirkgroenen/mopidy-mopify"&gt;mopidy-mopify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, this means one of us has to use aux or Bluetooth to play Spotify through the&amp;nbsp;speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mp3s"&gt;MP3s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my solutions to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; library problem are, unfortunately, pretty technical. I donât have any recommendations for people who are not comfortable with the&amp;nbsp;terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best-documented ways to share an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; library are &lt;a href="https://www.musicpd.org"&gt;mpd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mopidy.com"&gt;mopidy&lt;/a&gt;. Both solutions mostly work but are broken in some annoying way and donât have any truly great&amp;nbsp;clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use my own project, &lt;a href="https://github.com/irskep/summertunes"&gt;Summertunes&lt;/a&gt;. It glues together the &lt;a href="http://beets.io"&gt;beets&lt;/a&gt; extensible music library manager and &lt;a href="https://mpv.io"&gt;mpv&lt;/a&gt; player in an iTunes-like web interface. That means Casey and I can control the same library and playlist from any web browser on any device, including our phones. Itâs responsive and&amp;nbsp;reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Summertunes" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/home_audio_adventures/summertunes.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/"&gt;LaunchControl&lt;/a&gt; with some shell scripts to run &lt;code&gt;mpd&lt;/code&gt; and Summertunes on login, so I never need to mess with them manually unless they&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href="https://github.com/CDrummond/cantata/releases"&gt;Cantata&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPD&lt;/span&gt; client. Itâs not very Mac-like, but itâs easy enough to find your way&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cantata" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/home_audio_adventures/cantata.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPD&lt;/span&gt; if Iâm actively working on Summertunes and have temporarily hosed the installation. So about once per&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="input-passthrough"&gt;Input&amp;nbsp;passthrough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mac takes care of a lot by itself, but we still need to support a home theater &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;, Bluetooth adapter, and 3.5mm aux cable. Some external hardware is&amp;nbsp;necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have the Mac output to a switch, but Iâd rather just have everything merged into one signal so the music players work 100% of the time without having to remember what channel something is on. We can accomplish this using &lt;a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/"&gt;SoundSource&lt;/a&gt;, a $10 utility that lets you mirror your Macâs audio input to its&amp;nbsp;output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy SoundSource, run it, select âOpen Play-Thru Windowâ in the menu, and click âStart Play-Thru.â Youâll need to hit this button after every reboot, unfortunately. If you use SoundSource for this purpose, please join me in sending feature request via their &lt;a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showCategory=SoundSource"&gt;support form&lt;/a&gt; asking them to let us auto-enable&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SoundSource" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/home_audio_adventures/soundsource.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="audio-switching"&gt;Audio&amp;nbsp;switching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, weâve got a Mac hosting a music library and Spotify, which will pass through any input we send to it through its line-in port. We need to add Bluetooth, 3.5mm aux, and a home theater &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; on Amazon trying to find a device that does nothing but switch between 3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCA&lt;/span&gt; or 3.5mm inputs, and has a remote control. The reason this is hard to find is that most people use a stereo receiver, which is both an amplifier and a switch. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-R-S202BL-Stereo-Receiver/dp/B01EMQI2CU/"&gt;(Example, $150.)&lt;/a&gt; Stereo receiver remote controls never have fewer than 30 buttons. I donât want anything in my house that has a D-pad and isnât gaming&amp;nbsp;controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found exactly one device that fits my requirements: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HGISAOQ/"&gt;âiKKEGOL 5 Ways 4 Port &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; 1 Out Video Audio S-Video Game &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AV&lt;/span&gt; Switch Box Selector with Remote Control Av-666d Blackâ&lt;/a&gt;. It was twenty bucks and its remote has five buttons: four for input selection, one for&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The switch" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/home_audio_adventures/switch.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bluetooth"&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Bluetooth devices for home use are garbage, but some are less garbage than others. I have had okay but not great luck with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016NUTG5K/"&gt;this adapter from Esinkin&lt;/a&gt; and was totally dissatisfied by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SW0523A/"&gt;this one from iKross&lt;/a&gt;. I didnât realize it at the time, but &lt;a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-audio-receiver-for-your-home-stereo-or-speakers/"&gt;The Wirecutter has some suggestions that might be&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Bluetooth a lot less now that Summertunes is working and populated, so I care about this a lot less than I used&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pieces-of-flair"&gt;Pieces of&amp;nbsp;flair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every home across America with more than one audio source has a unique and probably awful system for getting audio from point A to point B. Ours is particularly unique! So I designed this handy reference card, and Casey printed it out on our brand new &lt;a href="https://cricut.com"&gt;Cricut&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The switch" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/home_audio_adventures/reference_card.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casey also gave the switcher remote the Cricut-assisted personal&amp;nbsp;touch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The switch" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/home_audio_adventures/remote.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weâre still left with a minor cable nest, but the volume of the whole setup is only about two Macbook&amp;nbsp;Pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="parting-thoughts"&gt;Parting&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing all this out, the first question I had for myself was whether it was all worth it. Shouldnât I have just bought a stereo&amp;nbsp;receiver?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâm still glad I didnât, if only because of those damn remote controls. And the mixing of two sources is really&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside is that the switch I ended up with is not very well built and introduces a tiny bit of hum. The remote has to be pointed straight at it for it to work, too. But on the other hand, itâs simpler than any other home audio system Iâve&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Steve Johnson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2017 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:steveasleep.com,2017-03-12:home-audio-with-os-x-and-cheap-consumer-electronics.html</guid><category>audio</category></item><item><title>Blogging about iOS architecture atÂ Hipmunk</title><link>http://steveasleep.com/ios-at-hipmunk.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote about the work I&amp;#8217;ve been doing at Hipmunk over the past year

&lt;p&gt;I write a lot of documentation. I do it for two reasons: I like writing, and I
like to be understood. Documentation is what takes software from âsomething
&lt;code&gt;@irskep&lt;/code&gt; put on GitHubâ to something you can actually&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Iâm not happy with the available tools. Open source documentation for young
projects tends to fall into one of three modes if they have it at&amp;nbsp;all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A GitHub&amp;nbsp;wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A directory of Markdown&amp;nbsp;files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proper web site, but requires a tool no one wants to install or a syntax
   no one knows, except one&amp;nbsp;maintainer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ecosystems have good, fairly well known tools (see Python and Sphinx), but
with the prevalence of Markdown and the convenience of hosting Markdown files
on GitHub, I suspect people have been tending toward the solutions with less&amp;nbsp;friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want it to be easier to produce good documentation sites, without GitHub
branding, with a bare-minimum learning curve, and a sky&amp;#8217;s-the-limit plugin
architecture, so that more projects have better&amp;nbsp;documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;ve succeeded. &lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/computerwords"&gt;Computer Words&lt;/a&gt;
is a tool written in Python 3 that lets you turn your &lt;a href="https://github.com/irskep/computerwords/tree/master/docs"&gt;directory of Markdown
files&lt;/a&gt; into a
&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/computerwords"&gt;beautiful web site&lt;/a&gt;, without
sacrificing important features like semantic cross-referencing.
It vaguely resembles &lt;a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; in its
design, so it has the potential for powerful plugins, but I did my best to
keep it small and easy to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your docs are currently in Markdown, these features might interest&amp;nbsp;you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All extensions use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; tag syntax, so your editor&amp;#8217;s syntax highlighting
  won&amp;#8217;t break. Other tools may or may not like it, depending on how they parse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; within&amp;nbsp;Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semantic linking. Rather than baking an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; reference into your links,
  define a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;heading-alias name="blah" /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; above any heading and insert a link
  to that heading with the correct name as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;heading-link name="blah" /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic multi-document table of contents auto-generated from your&amp;nbsp;headings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reasonable configuration can be as short as 4 obvious lines copied from the
  Computer Words home&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to auto-generate docs from a programming language besides Python,
and you are willing to write a docstring parser for your language (in your
language!), I would love to help you. The interchange format is very&amp;nbsp;simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 1.0 is a groundwork-focused release. The theme isn&amp;#8217;t very fancy, but
most of the pieces are in place to grow the system&amp;nbsp;cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you currently use Sphinx and reStructuredText, you should probably keep
doing that, but you might also want to read the &lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/computerwords/related_work.html"&gt;Related
Work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/computerwords/faq.html"&gt;Frequently

&lt;p&gt;Graffiti Labs is shutting down next month. I&amp;#8217;ll be spending June looking for
a new job &lt;em&gt;(edit: found one!)&lt;/em&gt; and honing my audio engineering&amp;nbsp;skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my first act of freedom, I&amp;#8217;m releasing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://slamjamsen.com/"&gt;Slam Jamsen&amp;#8217;s Salvage Operation
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of âbedroom tapesâ made between 2005 and 2009. The popular vision of a budding high school rock musician is a guitarist sitting on a bed writing bad love songs, but in my case, I was at a desk with a low-end Mac and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIDI&lt;/span&gt; keyboard, sharing the room with two more computers and a treadmill, writing bad video game&amp;nbsp;soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the rise of the 4-track, the cost of making decent home recordings has fallen at different rates for different genres. As a so-so piano student and early-to-mid-â00s Mac user, my options were limited at first to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIDI&lt;/span&gt; editors. When Appleâs Garageband program came out, and I finally got a copy, I discovered the world of software&amp;nbsp;synthesizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video game development was my other major hobby at the time, so it seemed obvious that I should write my own soundtracks. (Otherwise, I wouldnât have soundtracks at all, given my $0 budget.) My modus operandi was to constantly write songs for soundtracks for games that didnât exist yet, and pull out the best ones from my catalogue when I actually made a&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the tracks on this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; come from that process. Duty Calls was made for Escort Wing, a game designed and mostly programmed by Will Hogben. Glue Me Together and The Creature Sneaks were made for gw0rp, my entry into uDevGames 2008. Catastrophe Prelude was never used for anything, but written for a nonexistent&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, I built a Blue Man Group-style &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVC&lt;/span&gt; instrument for a science competition. Once built, it was too tempting to pass up making music with it, so I wrote Parakeet in the E.R., Unsolved, and a few more songs that donât appear on this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt;. Those tracks also feature my classmates Amanda Andrews with bizarro-world guitar parts, and Eric Baize with an ocarina. My brother Phil played the bluesy intro to Unsolved. âWheeee!â was made in the same batch, but doesnât feature the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That just leaves The Five Dollar Song, which Iâll just say was mostly written and played by Phil, with contributions from me, around&amp;nbsp;2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good free synthesizers that appear on this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; and are still around include daHornet, Automat, and&amp;nbsp;Remedy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Steve Johnson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:steveasleep.com,2015-04-25:slam-jamsen-salvage-operation-ep.html</guid><category>music</category></item><item><title>I played drums on this EP</title><link>http://steveasleep.com/the-nest-ep.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jams.thenestmusic.com/releases"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Nest EP album art" src="http://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2623181876_16.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

at an old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; with my friend Eric Drury to write the New Dork Times. Although it
ran for only nine issues published between 1997 and 1999, its biting social
commentary remains as relevant as&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I came across my personal archives of all nine issues of the
New Dork Times and decided they were worth two hours of attention to bring to a
modern digital audience. I now present to you an online time capsule from 16
years ago, lovingly typeset in its original Times New&amp;nbsp;Roman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/newdorktimes/"&gt;The New Dork Times â Digital&amp;nbsp;Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Steve Johnson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:steveasleep.com,2013-08-02:the-new-dork-times.html</guid><category>projects</category></item><item><title>Teaching inÂ Turin</title><link>http://steveasleep.com/teaching-in-turin.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I returned from teaching &amp;#8220;big data analysis with MapReduce&amp;#8221; at
Big Dive in Turin, Italy. Big Dive is a technology training program about data
science (applied statistics), visualization (displaying data in an
understandable way), and computer programming. Most of the students are in some
type of grad school. The tools they learn at Big Dive are helpful for
processing and presenting data for scientific&amp;nbsp;purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was there to teach &lt;a href="http://mrjob.readthedocs.org/"&gt;mrjob&lt;/a&gt;, a programming tool
that makes it easy to run code on lots of computers at once so analyses can be
run in minutes or hours rather than days. I was tapped to teach the course
because I worked on it while I was at&amp;nbsp;Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the nail-biting process of getting my passport on short notice and buying
some very expensive plane tickets, I boarded a plane. 18 exhausting hours
later, I met Alessandro Molina, one of my hosts. He took me to dinner and then
to my hotel, where I collapsed for the&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hotel was on the river. If I walked for 60 seconds, I saw&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="River" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/river.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="monday"&gt;Monday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up in time to order breakfast at a restaurant where none of the staff
spoke English. Pointing, gesturing, and pronunciation mangling was involved. My
stomach full, I walked to Big Dive early to get acquainted with the people and
the building, and to finish my notes and slides for the day. The walk between
my hotel and the Big Dive building (below) was consistently nice the whole
week despite the&amp;nbsp;heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Big Dive building" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/bigdive_building.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hours later I was ready to teach, but no lesson plan survives contact with
students. Having written much of the software they were learning, I was used to
just knowing things and donât have much of a beginnerâs mind about it anymore.
Additionally, their skill sets ranged from almost no programming knowledge to
proficient physics&amp;nbsp;PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, though, most students seemed to understand all the
relevant concepts. For dinner, Alessandro took me to Eataly, a well-known
collection of restaurants with authentic dishes from across Italy. I had&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasta" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/eataly.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we had Italian ice cream. Whatâs &amp;#8220;ice cream&amp;#8221; in Italian?
&amp;#8220;Gelato.&amp;#8221; I should also mention that &amp;#8220;coffee&amp;#8221; in Italy is straight espresso in
a tiny cup, &amp;#8220;American-style&amp;#8221; coffee is espresso and water (&amp;#8220;Americano,&amp;#8221; same as
you can get at any American coffee shop), and drip-brewed coffee is really
nowhere to be found. Strange and redundant language crossings abound,
apparently. I found out later that World War &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; plays a part in those
linguistic&amp;nbsp;shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tuesday"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning I went to the Egyptian museum. I enjoyed myself with an
English audio tour and donât have much else to say about it. Hereâs a cool
photo of a&amp;nbsp;sarcophagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marching band" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/egyptian_museum.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way out, I came across this police marching band. I think some kind of
ceremony was beginning, but I never figured it&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marching band" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/marching_band.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had too much coffee before teaching my second class and experienced an
intense caffeine crash at the end. I imagine the students were more than a
little confused about some of the&amp;nbsp;material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner, I was taken to an old school Italian tavern with Puria, one of
Alessandroâs coworkers. I ate a large amount of delicious food and drank a
large amount of delicious beer. Afterward, we found one of his friends and
enjoyed ourselves at a nearby bar until bed time. Hereâs a quick snap of the
inside of the&amp;nbsp;tavern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marching band" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/taverna.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="wednesday"&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last class of the week was in the morning. This one went much better than
the last, and by the end of the day I was confident that everyone understood
all the relevant technology. After class we all went to lunch, with gelato for
dessert. Then I resumed my tourist activities by going to the Mole
Antonelliana, which houses the Museum of Cinema. Itâs the tallest brick
building in the world. Hereâs the&amp;nbsp;outside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mole Antonelliana" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/mole_antonelliana.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the elevator to the&amp;nbsp;top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mole Antonelliana" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/mole_antonelliana_view.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didnât get any photographs of the inside of the museum, but itâs amazing.
Most of the interior is a single huge room stretching up into the spire. The
main exhibits are little rooms on the edges, and the special exhibit is a ramp
that spirals up the inner&amp;nbsp;walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puria took me to dinner again. I had a pasta dish and half a&amp;nbsp;lobster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="thursday"&gt;Thursday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my classes were over, I had to go to Big Dive once more to help answer
questions while the students worked on their final projects. From 10:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;
until 6:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, excluding lunch, I sat in the event space and read Wikipedia.
Once in a while someone would ask me for&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all had to leave at 6:30 so they could close the building, even though most
students werenât finished with their projects. Everyone agreed to meet half a
mile away in a couple of hours for aperitivos, i.e. happy hour with&amp;nbsp;food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived first because I thought I might get lost and padded my departure
time. Half an hour later everyone had arrived and we walked to the bar. Over
the course of the evening I solidified my friendship with the group (all the
students were there) and had a lot of interesting discussions about sports,
culture, movies, and personal lives. At the end of the night, I finally felt
like I had actual new&amp;nbsp;friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Most of the students" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/all_the_students.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth, a friend of a student, was visiting and needed something to do on Friday.
We agreed to be tourists together. His family moved to Canada from Bulgaria
when he was young, and now he&amp;#8217;s studying at a university in a European country
I can&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="friday"&gt;Friday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth and I met at 11 to see the royal palace. I can confirm that it was both
royal and&amp;nbsp;palacious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Palace dining room" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/palace_dining_room.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereâs a cheesy tourist shot of me outside a different&amp;nbsp;palace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cheesy tourist shot" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/cheesy_tourist_shot.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the palace, we visited the Royal Armory and the Archaeology Museum. We
werenât allowed to take photos, soâ¦there arenât any&amp;nbsp;photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch at a hip baked potato joint (Did I mention Yelp is near useless in
Turin?), followed by &amp;#8220;coffee with cream,&amp;#8221; i.e. espresso with heaps of whipped
cream on top. Our stomachs full, Seth and I crossed the river to walk up a big
hill to a church. The view from there should give a better idea of the size of
the Mole Antonelliana, and how few really tall buildings there are in&amp;nbsp;Turin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="View from across the river" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/across_the_river.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just hiked up and down a big hill, lesser travelers might have gone for
a nap. But Seth and I are urbanites accustomed to hoofing it across the city at
all times of day, so we opted to walk the length of a nearby park instead. It
reminded me of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco because of its length, general
atmosphere, and proximity to the water. There were beautiful views of the river
the whole way. After we had walked for a few hours, incuding through a
recreation of a medieval village, we got gelato and then parted&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, I boarded a tram. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t an ordinary tram; it was a
moving gourmet&amp;nbsp;restaurant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The magic tram" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/turin/magic_tram.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though no one on the train spoke English, I managed to order red wine and
enjoyed my dinner immensely. (One of the reasons I chose this event in the
first place was its fixed menu.) It was an appropriate end to a great&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Dreamers is an abstract online sandbox that placed sixth in the Innovation
category of Ludum Dare 26.
&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/we_dreamers_2"&gt;You can play it here.&lt;/a&gt; It may take a
while for the 4+ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; of user data to download, so give it a minute or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all my programming escapades over the past couple of years, I&amp;#8217;m most proud
of this one. Here&amp;#8217;s a comprehensive collection of my thoughts about it,
including a discussions of the technical&amp;nbsp;aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conception"&gt;Conception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the final voting round for Ludum Dare 26, I spent a couple of hours
coming up with good ideas for every possible themeâ¦except minimalism. No way
that would get through,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that theme was chosen, and I had to throw out all of my wonderful schemes,
most of which were single player pseudo-roguelikes. Instead, I picked a vague
idea: a web-based multiplayer world where you dig out rooms underground in a
grid. Maybe there would be shapes and colors and stuff. Genius! I figured out
the rest as I went&amp;nbsp;along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do a few&amp;nbsp;things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move with the arrow keys or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WASD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvest color with&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dig out new rooms by bumping into walls. You need color to do this. The new 
   room will be the color of your dot, which is affected by the color in your&amp;nbsp;bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dump color with r, g, and b (or 1, 2, and 3) to change the color of your&amp;nbsp;dot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave notes on rooms (if you are level 2) that appear at the bottom of the 
   screen when you enter the&amp;nbsp;room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put down big block letters (if you are level 3) that you can use to spell 
   [sometimes naughty]&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gain levels by adding content. If anyone else is online at the same time as
you, you can see their dot and any content they add, all&amp;nbsp;live-updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot" src="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2m-300x207.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="competition-results"&gt;Competition&amp;nbsp;results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It placed 6th in the Innovation category out of 2,346 games. The rest of the
category scores aren&amp;#8217;t as impressive as raw numbers but are still nice in terms
of the number of&amp;nbsp;games:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Innovation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.38&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mood&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#210&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Overall&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#238&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.51&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Audio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#464&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Theme&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#492&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Humor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#549&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Graphics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#650&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.92&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fun&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#769&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to have one of two viewpoints. Theyâre either like
&lt;a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;amp;uid=22915"&gt;wrongcoder&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neat. Quite unique. Technologically a marvel for the available time. To be
honest, though, I donât get the purpose of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or theyâre like &lt;a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;amp;uid=8308"&gt;BlennosoftGames&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something very cheerful about this game. As far as I can tell you
donât âwinâ you just smile&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most players were in the second category, so Iâm very happy with how it turned
out. People seem to understand what Iâm trying to do: create a virtual canvas
where contribution is easy, bad behavior is difficult, and quirky things can be
found given a few minutesâ exploration.
&lt;a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;amp;uid=11022"&gt;Hegemege&lt;/a&gt;
said it âfelt a bit like geocaching,â which really tickles&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are encouraging as well. When I checked earlier today, there were
&lt;strong&gt;3,019 rooms dug by 147 users.&lt;/strong&gt; 54% of players dug 5 or more rooms, with some
people digging over 100 rooms. 11% had a note on them. 18% had a stamp. So
people were definitely doing more than running around and bumping into&amp;nbsp;walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was surprised that more rooms had stamps than notes, since you have
to be level 2 to write a note, and level 3 to place a stamp. But it was pointed
out to me that a stamp is just one letter, and you have to think a lot less to
put one down. Want to spell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FART&lt;/span&gt; in huge letters? Itâs only seven easy&amp;nbsp;pieces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a friendly nod from a post on &lt;a href="http://indiestatik.com/2013/04/29/ludum-dare-26/"&gt;Indie Statik&amp;#8217;s Ludum Dare
highlights&lt;/a&gt;. They compared We
Dreamers to Peter Molyneuxâs game Curiosity. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if that&amp;#8217;s a
compliment, but itâs still nice to be noticed. They have a &lt;a href="http://indiestatik.com/2013/05/02/ludum-dare-25-part-2/"&gt;second highlights
post&lt;/a&gt; as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="technical-details"&gt;Technical&amp;nbsp;details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, like
&lt;a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;amp;uid=20822"&gt;StuStutheBloo&lt;/a&gt;
in We Dreamersâs comments, &lt;strong&gt;âHow did you even put this together in the time&amp;nbsp;available?â&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that I used &lt;a href="https://www.firebase.com/"&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;, âa cloud
database designed to power real-time, collaborative applications.â Put another
way, itâs a magic, event-driven Javascript object that updates instantly across
all clients. I didnât have to write a server, or even deal with much
multiplayer logic at all; I just designed all interactive objects to listen to
Firebase events. The only thing special about the dot you control, as opposed
to those controlled by others and displayed on your screen, is that your client
is updating a Firebase subtree for your data. Those updates are reflected
instantly for you, and very quickly for everyone&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to try your hand at a multiplayer online game for Ludum Dare, I
strongly recommend that you try Firebase.&lt;/strong&gt; There are half a dozen two-player
games I havenât been able to rate because Iâd need to have another person
sitting next to me to play with. You donât even need to get all crazy and
realtime â itâs also perfect for turn-based games. I hope to try something
head-to-head next&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for a longer answer to StuStutheBooâs question. Although Firebase was
essential to having the technical capability to build this kind of online
experience, it was even more important that I knew my tools extremely well. My
day job is to work on &lt;a href="http://playbuildy.com/"&gt;Buildy&lt;/a&gt;, an online multiplayer
realtime building sandbox where you can make just about anything. For &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LD26&lt;/span&gt;, I
brought out the same tools we use to make Buildy: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://coffeescript.org/"&gt;Coffeescript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://gruntjs.com/"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js"&gt;Bacon.js&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/"&gt;SoundManager2&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://jquery.com/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://craig.is/killing/mice"&gt;Mousetrap&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="http://underscorejs.org/"&gt;underscore.js&lt;/a&gt;. The whole game is a bunch of static
files hosted on Github Pages, just like the rest of steveasleep.com.  To
deploy, all I had to do was push to the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didnât do anything I hadnât done before. All of the rendering is just styled
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements. Iâm familiar with each of those Javascript libraries. Iâm
comfortable with the Chrome dev tools. Static files are incredibly easy to
deploy and serve without paying a dime. As a result of using all these familiar
pieces, I spent almost no time debugging simple (or even complicated)&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youâre looking for advice about how to do Ludum Dare well, hereâs mine:
&lt;strong&gt;learn your tools.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you know how to write, run, and deploy your
game.  Donât give yourself any surprises. (Python developers have a
particularly tough time with this one. There are still a few that ask you to
install PyGame to play and rate their game. I sympathize, having used py2app
for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LD19&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend any time in Javascript, try to get your head around
&lt;a href="https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js"&gt;Bacon.js&lt;/a&gt;. It can decrease game logic
complexity by quite a lot if youâre willing to invest your brain resources in
it. We Dreamers would have had 30% more code and been 30% buggier without&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="downsides-and-difficulties"&gt;Downsides and&amp;nbsp;difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereâs another, secret reason why I was able to write We Dreamers so fast: I
didnât give more than a passing thought about scale. I had no idea how much
data users would generate (currently ~4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt;) or how well browsers would deal
with 6000+ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; elements moving around (not very well). Buildy partitions its
worlds into squares, so itâs easy to only load a piece at a time. We Dreamers
has no such wisdom, so every user loads the entire world when the page loads.
Threeish megabytes isnât so bad for a game, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; performance turned out to
be a huge issue once things got big. To help players deal with the speed, I now
provide a stripped down version that web browsers can handle&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to do all the rendering via styled &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s because I wanted to spend
as little time as possible on drawing code. I gambled that web browsers would
be smart enough to efficiently clip offscreen nodes. It almost worked, but I
really should have used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been much more&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a tiny bit of trouble with cross-browser compatibility.
&lt;code&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt; still hasnât been un-prefixed in Firefox or Safari.
Safari didnât like any of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; gradient variants I tried either, so the
doors are all white when viewed in that browser. In the end, though, I was able
to make it widely compatible and consistent. (This is another issue that would
have been avoided had I used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite using Firebase, here was one aspect of distributed computing I did have
to deal with: syncing the time across all clients to get the color harvesting
to look right. I thought I was being clever by using a public web service that
gives you the current time in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;. Unfortunately itâs hosted on Google App
Engine and blew through its quota soon after voting started, so now all the
playersâ clocks are wrong anyway. It doesnât affect the game much, but I should
have seen it&amp;nbsp;coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one last issue that I was always aware of but never had time to deal
with: access controls. There are no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;-level restrictions on who can edit what
data. At least one person exploited it to leave me an amusing note, but
fortunately there were no abusers. Firebase has the ability to use access
controls, but I didn&amp;#8217;t have time to learn their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Another reason to know
my tools really well, I&amp;nbsp;suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-closing"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;closing,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a fun and intense time this year. Of my three attempts to date, We
Dreamers is far and away my best Ludum Dare effort yet. I plan to come back for
another round in August for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LD27&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Steve Johnson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:steveasleep.com,2013-05-04:we-dreamers-postmortem.html</guid><category>games</category></item><item><title>What Iâve been doingÂ lately</title><link>http://steveasleep.com/what-ive-been-doing-lately.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started my new job at Graffiti Labs after working at Yelp for

read. In rereading it, I found almost as much as when I first experienced it at
nine years&amp;nbsp;old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Book cover" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/basic_programming_for_kids.jpg" title="**BASIC Programming for Kids** by Roz Ault" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to know is that since it was published in 1983, I
didn&amp;#8217;t know how to find an interpreter for the code in 1999. All examples were
run via thought experiment. Because of this fact, I think that this book did
more to get me excited about the idea of programming than it did to impart
knowledge. In this way, I think it follows a higher-level version of the &amp;#8220;give
a man a fish&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will teach you how to write simple programs in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; for your
computer. Its purpose, however, is not to make you a programmer. Its purpose
is to help you understand computers, to think about how computers can help
you in all kinds of ways, and to discover how much fun you can have when you
learn how to talk to&amp;nbsp;computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="content"&gt;Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; Programming for Kids&lt;/strong&gt; explains how to write simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; programs for
The Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;+/e, Atari 400/800, Commodore 64/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PET&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIC&lt;/span&gt; 20, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TI&lt;/span&gt; 99/4A, Timex
Sinclair 1000, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRS&lt;/span&gt;-80. (The programs still run in Chipmunk Basic.) The fact
that such a book could be written for ten different platforms is a testament to
the ubiquity of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; in personal computers at the time, but the book does
spend a lot of time explaining special cases and how to rewrite the examples so
that they run on some of the platforms. (Apparently the Timex Sinclair 1000 was
an awful&amp;nbsp;machine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with a 30-page chapter on how to type and use the prompts on the
various platforms. Then the language is taught over ten chapters, with
exercises at the end of each chapter. There is a final chapter with some
example programs, and then appendices for reference, troubleshooting, editing,
and information about computers in&amp;nbsp;general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a quick example to refresh your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;NEW
10 FOR J = 1 TO 5 
20 PRINT &amp;quot;JUMP&amp;quot;;J 
30 FOR C = 1 TO 3 
40 PRINT &amp;quot;CLAP&amp;quot;;C 
50 NEXT C 
60 NEXT J 
RUN
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After rereading the book cover to cover, I have only two new thoughts. First,
that the author did a good job of conveying the joy of computing to young
readers. Second, that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; language was an awful mess but succeeded for
very good&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="review-positive"&gt;Review:&amp;nbsp;Positive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good book. I&amp;#8217;m glad I found it when I went looking for it. Here&amp;#8217;s an
example that follows a description of what variables&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can put variables in a program, like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;NEW
10 N = 2
20 X = 5
30 PRINT N + X
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What will that program print? Run it and see if you guessed correctly. Notice
that lines 10 and 20 don&amp;#8217;t make anything happen on the screen when you run
the program. They tell the program to do something &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the computer, but
only the word &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRINT&lt;/span&gt; makes a message appear on the&amp;nbsp;screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now change lines 10 and 20 to give the variables some different&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a small, self-contained, understandable example with a concise, complete
explanation and an invitation to experiment. In this way, it mirrors the style
of Zed Shaw&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.com/"&gt;Learn Python The Hard
Way&lt;/a&gt;. It never blames the reader for
being wrong, and in fact seems to encourage the reader to forgive his or her
own mistakes while writing&amp;nbsp;programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, it&amp;#8217;s a good book. But about this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;thing&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="basic-sucked-but-worse-was-better"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; Sucked, But Worse Was&amp;nbsp;Better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, what is this crap? Specifying a line number for each statement
before the program is finished? &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REM&lt;/span&gt;? &lt;em&gt;No proper functions?&lt;/em&gt; How did anyone
survive&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the alternative was to use assembly, or to slip into an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; laboratory.&amp;nbsp;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two great things about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; as it existed in personal computers was that
it was &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; simple, and it was &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. Ault was able to describe
almost the entire language with extensive examples in a hundred pages of large
print, and those pages covered the vast majority of PCs on the market at the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I was able to understand the book without actually using a computer
was because of the simplicity of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; and because of Ault&amp;#8217;s ability to explain
it using terms no more complex than necessary. At this point I should mention
that this book may not actually be the very first programming book I read, but
it was certainly the first one I understood. I really don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="and-also-worse"&gt;&amp;#8230;And Also&amp;nbsp;Worse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before rereading this book, I had mostly forgotten what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; really was, and
didn&amp;#8217;t necessarily agree with the statement that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; causes brain damage. Now
I agree wholeheartedly, and I speak from experience. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; crippled me for&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; is a crappy way to express a state machine. The syntax
encourages tight, unreadable balls of spaghetti. &lt;code&gt;GOSUB&lt;/code&gt; is a poor way to break
out functions. Most of the punctuation feels very ad&amp;nbsp;hoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t help but contrast this mess with Scheme. All other concerns aside,
Scheme makes a great teaching language because there is almost no syntax and
code is inherently hierarchical. Beginners simply learn new words. Everything
else is&amp;nbsp;gravy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#8217;t learn Scheme, I learned &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; and stuck with it for about six
years. I went from &lt;a href="http://www.truebasic.com/"&gt;TrueBASIC&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.vellios.com/2010/06/06/basic-compiler-opensourced/"&gt;Visual
MacStandardBasic&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080321015004/www.iit.edu/~sarimar/GDS/metal.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;METAL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/"&gt;BlitzMax&lt;/a&gt;. I would occasionally try to learn a
new language, but would quickly become frustrated with the lack of easy-to-use
IDEs and graphics libraries. (During this period I was writing nothing but&amp;nbsp;games.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;METAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; had few features and libraries, but for me that was
as much of a strength as it was a weakness. Rather than spending hours
searching for which giant package to import, I could browse a complete list of
commands less than twenty pages long to find what I needed, modules and
namespaces be damned. When I was done writing a game, I could click &amp;#8220;Compile&amp;#8221;
and email it to my friends instead of asking them to download Joe Shmoe Player
3000 or tearing my hair out over config files. (For this reason, I think
Processing and BlitzMax are currently the best platforms to learn game
programming&amp;nbsp;with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent so much time in the game bubble that I missed out on many early
opportunities to learn new language&amp;nbsp;concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-everyone-knows-is-wrong-today"&gt;What Everyone Knows Is Wrong&amp;nbsp;Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s popular languages are objectively better than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; in every way.
Features, syntax, libraries, the works. But for a kid who wants to write games
by typing into a window and clicking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COMPILE&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUN&lt;/span&gt;, the language options are
limited to Processing, BlitzMax, and whatever GameMaker uses. None of these
are real-world languages, so anyone starting out with them will not have a
smooth transition to the next stage in their development as a master of&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t bother rehashing what others have said about this problem or yearn for
the days of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt;-prompt-as-main-interface. I&amp;#8217;ll just say this: make better
tools, write more books and&amp;nbsp;tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="resources"&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inventwithpython.com/"&gt;Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python&lt;/a&gt;
is comparable to &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; Programming for Kids&lt;/em&gt;. Better, even. Python&amp;#8217;s tools are
not ideal for children, but they are good enough to teach programming&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to create games with a good write/run/distribute tool, but
not necessarily with good documentation for those new to&amp;nbsp;programming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.processing.org/"&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blitzmax.com/"&gt;BlitzMax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/make"&gt;GameMaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Steve Johnson</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2011 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:steveasleep.com,2011-01-10:the-first-programming-book-i-ever-read.html</guid><category>programming</category></item><item><title>Space TrainÂ Postmortem</title><link>http://steveasleep.com/space-train-postmortem.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Space Train logo" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_logo.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the end of a semester just past, my course projects are all bubbling up in
various states of completion. One of these is a point-and-click adventure game
called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/space-train.html"&gt;Space Train: Terror on the Mustachio
Express&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, developed by a team of
students from the &lt;a href="http:/www.cia.edu/"&gt;Cleveland Institute of Art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http:/www.case.edu"&gt;Case
Western Reserve University&lt;/a&gt;. Its technical components
include an event-driven level scripting system, characters, items, inventory,
dialogue, and more.  The engine is written in Python using my game programming
weapon of choice, the &lt;a href="http:/www.pyglet.org"&gt;pyglet&lt;/a&gt; library. The&amp;nbsp;plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inga Borga is a poetry-loving senior citizen. One of her favorite authors,
Stanislov Slavinsky, is reading his poetry live on the nearby Planet Deux, a
short hop by space train from Inga&amp;#8217;s home. She wants nothing more than to see
Stanislav in person, so she catches the Mustachio Express to Planet Deux.
Little does she know it will be a bumpy&amp;nbsp;ride&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds grand, right? We thought so too, but in typical student fashion we
failed to account for one thing: &lt;strong&gt;adventure games take a lot of work to
make.&lt;/strong&gt; As a result, the game is only about twenty minutes long. Even so, we
all learned from the&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-course"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Course&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EECS&lt;/span&gt; 390 - Advanced Game Development Project&amp;#8221; is a joint course between the
Cleveland Institute of Art and Case Western Reserve University. Teams of 6-12
artists and programmers collaborate to produce some sort of game. At the end of
the course, the teams present to their peers and to Electronic Arts staff for
questions and critique. The course is currently taught by Dr. Marc Buchner
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CWRU&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://www.knuthybinette.com/"&gt;Knut Hybinette&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIA&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two games made this semester were Kalotai, a location-aware monster
collection/battle game for Android, and Louder Than Words, a platformer with
branching story lines based on a morality&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-it-went-down"&gt;How It Went&amp;nbsp;Down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all arrived at 8:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; on the first day of class, heavily caffeinated.
Everyone put ideas on a white board and then divided into three teams based on
interest. My team ended up with four programmers and six artists, with me as
team leader. We immediately decided on some basics and began working on a
schedule. By 9:45, we had drawn a crazy whiteboard&amp;nbsp;diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was already clear that we would make the best game ever. The drawing was so
good we didn&amp;#8217;t even need a design document. We wrote one anyway because it was
a course requirement. We spent the next month and a half developing the
environments and the characters, fleshing out plot points, and writing the game&amp;nbsp;engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class was only scheduled to meet for an hour every week, which was far from
enough time to get anything done. Most of our communication was done on Fridays
in a classroom when we met to give status updates, brainstorm new directions,
and work on the schedule. During the week, we communicated via a mailing list,
shared files using a &lt;a href="http:/www.dropbox.com"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; shared folder, and
pushed code back and forth with &lt;a href="http:/www.git-scm.org/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the halfway point, we presented our work to the class. Our demo revealed
some significant issues, none of which were technical: the character art lacked
a consistent style, the story was not cohesive, and there were no clear puzzle
designs. The characters we did have were shallow and stereotyped. This was not
a good situation to be in for a story-based and art-heavy&amp;nbsp;game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We immediately changed our art and story development processes. Rather than
have three or four artists take characters all the way from concept to final
execution, we split all character work into line work, coloring, and shading,
and assigned one artist to each stage of the pipeline. Rather than working from
a vague, error-prone shared idea of a partially-recorded story, I spent a few
hours writing detailed scripts for each level we planned to implement. We
followed this process to the end, and it worked beautifully. We had a very
slick&amp;nbsp;demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some screenshots of the&amp;nbsp;game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_screenshot_1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 1" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_thumb_1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the stages of the game&amp;#8217;s artistic&amp;nbsp;development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_art_1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Concept Art" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_art_1_thumb.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_art_3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Flat Color" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_art_3_thumb.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_art_4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Object/Furniture Design" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_art_4_thumb.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_art_5.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rendered Art" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/space_train_art_5_thumb.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lessons-learned"&gt;Lessons&amp;nbsp;Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never been in a months-long team leadership position before. My
experience organizing &lt;a href="http:/hacsoc.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CWRU&lt;/span&gt; Hacker Society&lt;/a&gt; helped, but
that was more cat herding than game building. By the end of the course the
team had worked out a process by trial and error that seemed to produce
results, but by the time we found that process, it was really too late to save
the&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="schedule"&gt;Schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent too much time thinking up random characters and not enough time
fitting them into a big picture. We should have started writing
pseudo-screenplays or storyboards to work from by the third week. That would
have made it easier for us to give the artists specific tasks, a problem we had
early&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storyboards would have given us the opportunity to implement parts of the
levels, which would have helped us develop a scripting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. For most of the
semester, we worked with an ad-hoc &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. We ended up redesigning it in the last
week because it wasn&amp;#8217;t working for us&amp;nbsp;anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adventure-games-are-hard-to-make"&gt;Adventure Games Are Hard to&amp;nbsp;Make&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every game I have ever made has involved bullets. That usually means
those bullets are heading for a relatively small number of enemy types, are
flying over relatively simple pre-rendered or procedurally generated terrain,
and have very simple animations. In an adventure game, everything the player
sees has a unique design and multiple animations. The average screen time of a
given image is minutes or less. Even though we were working with six artists,
we were barely able to finish our 20 minutes of play&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="communication-is-key"&gt;Communication is&amp;nbsp;Key&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encouraged communication by providing as many useful collaboration tools as
possible. Without constant communication, Space Train would have been a total&amp;nbsp;failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping all live game assets in a shared Dropbox folder, we guaranteed
instant availability of the artists&amp;#8217; work without using a cumbersome email
system or an artist-unfriendly version control system. Our consistent meeting
format was usually effective at giving everyone concrete goals for the week.
Git, of course, is the ideal code collaboration tool. The mailing list filled
in any&amp;nbsp;gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="course-project-group-dynamics-are-weird"&gt;Course Project Group Dynamics are&amp;nbsp;Weird&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always felt uncomfortable with the way course project groups are formed.
Usually they form around ideas, not around teams, and that was explicitly the
case with this course. This means that team dynamics are a total crapshoot, and
if things go south, you&amp;#8217;re locked in for three months and your success is
irrevocably chained together. By the end of the course, we effectively had two
programmers and four artists, with four other people functioning as dead&amp;nbsp;weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conspicuously-absent-from-this-list"&gt;Conspicuously Absent From This&amp;nbsp;List:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant code issues. We really powered through the engine and never got
hindered by any major design flaws. The game&amp;#8217;s source code is &lt;a href="http:/www.github.com/irskep/Space-Train"&gt;on
Github&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not beautiful, but it
worked well enough for&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-team"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;: Lead programmer, screenplay, music, engine, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susie Kim&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Objects&lt;/li&gt;
