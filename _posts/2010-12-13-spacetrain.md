Inga Borga is a poetry-loving senior citizen. One of her favorite authors,
Stanislov Slavinsky, is reading his poetry live on the nearby Planet Deux, a
short hop by space train from Ingaâ€™s home. She wants nothing more than to see
Stanislav in person, so she catches the Mustachio Express to Planet Deux.
Little does she know it will be a bumpy ride...

Space Train is a short point-and-click adventure game developed over the course
of a semester by students at the [Cleveland Institute of
Art](http://www.cia.edu/) and [Case Western Reserve
University](http://www.case.edu/). It features a dynamic, event-driven level
scripting engine that supports characters, items, inventory, dialogue, and
more. Space Train is written in [Python](http://www.python.org) using the
[pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org) library.

The game is very short, but it serves as a great demo for the engine and as a
showcase for the artists who put so much love into the environments and
characters.

The project was supervised by Dr. Marc Buchner, Case Western Reserve University
and Knut Hybinette, Cleveland Institute of Art.
