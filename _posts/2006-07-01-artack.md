Pencil-drawn invaders from outer space are attacking the bottom of a sheet of
notebook paper. Destroy them for the sake of the motherland!

In other words, it's a Galaxian clone with graphics drawn in colored pencil.

I collaborated with Kemal Zhang of [Zhang Games](http://www.zhanggames.com/)
for a three-week competition held by [iDevGames](http://www.idevgames.com/) in
June 2006.
