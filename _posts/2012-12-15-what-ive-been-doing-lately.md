Two months ago I started my new job at Graffiti Labs (we make
[Buildy](http://playbuildy.com)) after working at Yelp for almost a year and a
half. During that time, I did a lot of work on
[mrjob](http://mrjob.readthedocs.org/) and
[tron](http://packages.python.org/tron/).

Now I spend my days using the Chrome web tools to make a collaborative sandbox
web game. I have a few technical blog posts over at the [Buildy
Blog](http://blog.playbuildy.com/). I also work on [Literally
Canvas](http://literallycanvas.com/), and open source HTML5 drawing widget.
