Title: Steve Landey, Software Engineer
Slug: professional

Thank you for clicking the link!

I’m a broadly-experienced software engineer soon to be based out of **Seattle, WA**. I want to join a small or small-ish company and build a great product.

Some job titles I am often a good fit for at the senior or staff level include "iOS engineer," "fullstack engineer," and "frontend engineer." I am open to management roles given the right circumstances.
