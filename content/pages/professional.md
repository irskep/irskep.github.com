## What I actually do at Asana

“Mobile Area” refers to all four cross-functional mobile teams within Asana.

### Identify and mitigate technical risks across the Mobile Area

I’ve been at Asana basically forever in startup years. I use my holistic view of the iOS and Android code, and the people on the team, to identify places where we might run into trouble, or are actively running into trouble. Then I do whatever it takes to solve the problem, balancing it against the Mobile Area’s other priorities.

The main place this shows up is in how I’ve evolved our app architecture over time. Early mobile hires often make a mess (which is fine! they’re shipping!) and we’ve dealt with tangled dependencies of global singletons, huge view controllers, slow build times, and deprecated APIs. In each of these cases, I’ve made a long-term plan, worked with various stakeholders to prioritize and fix specific areas, and managed the efforts of multiple people to meet the goal.

### Build stuff really fast

I have a reputation as the fastest engineer in the Mobile Area. It’s a mix of understanding Asana’s existing code, having deep knowledge of UIKit, and having lots of practice building many types of projects for fun outside of work. It is rare for my code to have maintainability problems.

For a list of the most important user-facing features I’ve built for Asana, see [Timeline](https://steveasleep.com/timeline/).

### Lead small company-wide areas with no clear ownership structure

I’m responsible for Asana’s engineering blog, and for helping people release open source software. Sometimes I also help out with the intern program and with designing interview questions.
