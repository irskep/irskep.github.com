# Experience

Succesfully drove a rearchitecture of legacy iOS code base. Became team lead

Contributed to game and UI design. Worked with server-side Python, JavaScript,
Salt Stack, nearly every HTML5 technology, React.js, web page performance, more

evolution of a large codebase over time.
## Maintainer, [Literally Canvas](http://literallycanvas.com) — 2012-present
