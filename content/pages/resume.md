I want to make something people love and fight the gradual decline of society.

# Experience

## Game & web developer, [Buildy](http://playbuild.com) — 2012-present

Designed and developed an HTML5 game about building creatively in an isometric world. Contributed to game design. Worked with server-side Python, JavaScript, Salt Stack, nearly every HTML5 technology, React, web page performance, more JavaScript, UI design, Pyramid-based admin site, SQLAlchemy, iOS (Obj-C and Swift), large codebase evolution, self-awareness, humility.

## Maintainer, [Literally Canvas](http://literallycanvas.com) — 2012-present

Designed, implemented, and documented an HTML5-based drawing tool that can be used as a JavaScript library. Worked as a freelancer to add features when approached.

## Spam warrior, [Yelp](http://yelp.com) — 2011-2012

Worked on mrjob, the leading Python framework for writing Hadoop jobs, eventually becoming the primary maintainer. Developed MapReduce-based spam filters. Created a new admin web app for the spam team. Briefly maintained the Tron distributed batch scheduler. Fought with Amazon Web Services a lot.

## Obj-C Runtime Intern, Apple — 2010
Implemented a new runtime analysis tool for Xcode Instruments and used it to uncover bugs in software under development. The visual object graph in the Leaks instrument resembles a simplified version of the project, though I doubt it’s the same code.
