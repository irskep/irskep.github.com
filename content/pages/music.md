### [Hide](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/music/Hide.mp3)
Techno with some grungy guitar by my then-13-year-old brother. Good stuff. This track is in gw0rp.

### [The Creature Sneaks](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/music/The%20Creature%20Sneaks.mp3)
A very laid back track that might make you feel a little bit like a spy in the '80s. This track is also in gw0rp.

### [Glue Me Together](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/music/Glue%20Me%20Together.mp3)
The opening track of gw0rp. I plan to expand it with vocals at some point in the distant future, but for now, it's a nice piece.

### [Jingle Bombs](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/music/Jingle%20Bombs.mp3)
A demented Christmas song mash-up.

### [Singing Lessons](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/Singing%20Lessons.mp3)
Out of tune melodies never sounded so good.

### [Suspense16](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/music/Suspense16.mp3)
A throwback to your Gameboy days. Loops nicely.

### [No Return](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/music/No%20Return.mp3)
One of two tracks for Escort Wing.

### [Duty Calls](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/music/Duty%20Calls%20%28w_%20guitar%29.mp3)
The other Escort Wing track. Catchy melody.

### [Catastrophe Prelude](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/music/Catastrophe%20Prelude.mp3)
Electronics. Suspense. 3/4 time.

### [Parakeet in the E.R.](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/Parakeet%20in%20the%20E.R..mp3)
Funky, blippy song featuring the PVC instrument I build for Science Olympiad my senior year of high school.

### [Unsolved](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360865/Unsolved.mp3)
A contemplative jam. Ocarina by Eric Baize, guitars by Phillip Johnson and Amanda Andrews, PVC by myself.

### [Super Mario Bros. Theme for 3 Cellos](http://filer.case.edu/srj15/music2/SuperMarioBrosCello.zip)
This arrangement may contain one or two minor errors. I would be interested in where they are.

### [Blackbird for 1 Cello](http://filer.case.edu/srj15/music2/Blackbird.pdf)
The guitar part of Blackbird. Add a singer and work on those plucking skills.

### [Goodbye Blue Sky for 5 Cellos](http://filer.case.edu/srj15/music2/GoodbyeBlueSky.pdf)
An cello ensemble version of all of The Wall would be pretty amazing, no?
