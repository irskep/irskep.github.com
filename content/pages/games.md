Slug: games

Game programming is the hobby I always told myself would never become a
[job](|filename|/posts/2012-12-15-what-ive-been-doing-lately.md). I've been
making games almost exactly as long as I've been programming, and many of them
you could almost call playable. Here's a chronological list of games I made
that you can get to run in some form.

None of my 2001-2005 METAL BASIC creations survived various file transfers,
web site backups, and hard drive failures. Canvas Wars, Retro Defender, Past
Blasters, and Last Hope are lost forever.
