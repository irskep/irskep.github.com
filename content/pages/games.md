Title: Games I've written
Slug: games

(I also track my [opinions of games](<|filename|game-reviews.md>).)

Game programming is the hobby I always told myself would never become a
[job](|filename|/posts/2012-12-15-what-ive-been-doing-lately.md). I've been
making games almost exactly as long as I've been programming, and many of them
you could almost call playable. Here's a chronological list of games I made
that you can get to run in some form.

* [Escort Wing](<|filename|escort-wing.md>) (2005)
* [Artack](<|filename|artack.md>) (2006)
* [Elite Bungie Chopper Squadron](http://www.pyweek.org/e/idg/) (2009)
* [gw0rp](<|filename|gw0rp.md>) (2009)
* [Lizard Wizard](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3120) (2010)
* [Space Train](<|filename|space-train.md>) (2010)
* [We Dreamers](http://steveasleep.com/we_dreamers) (2013)
* [Buildy](http://playbuildy.com) (2013)

Unfortunately, none of my middle school-era METAL BASIC creations survived
various file transfers, web site backups, and hard drive failures. I am
sincerely sad to say that the world may never again see Canvas Wars, Canvas
Wars 2, Retro Defender, Past Blasters, or Last Hope.
