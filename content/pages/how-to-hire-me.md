Title: How to hire me
Date: 2017-08-24

If I sent you this link, it's because I'm taking you seriously as a prospective
recruiter or employer. It's all stuff you'd get from the usual email exchanges
and 30 minute intro calls, but my hope is that it's more efficient and friendly
for both of us!

If any of this sounds weirdly off-putting, please let me know, because I'm
honestly trying to be helpful. I only mention that because what I'm doing here
seems unusual.

## Deal breakers

* Long commute from Glen Park. My current commute is 30 minutes on a bike. It's
  my only exercise. Mountain View is too far. (Good remote work culture would
  mitigate this.) 
* Open office without a guarantee of quiet. (Good remote work culture would
  also mitigate this.)
* Your company is likely helping to bring about the downfall of humanity or
  [some other sort of slow-motion apocalypse](https://io9.gizmodo.com/william-gibson-on-the-apocalypse-america-and-the-peri-1656659382).

## Why it will be hard for you to hire me

I've been a manager since January 2016, not yet a full year. Because of that,
it's tricky for me to change jobs until early next year, because I really want
to have leveled up before I leave this behind.

When I do decide to leave, I want to make sure the team is in a good position,
which probably means I'll want to give lots of notice.

## What I want to do next

### Manager or individual contributor?

I'm on the fence about whether I want to pursue a management or IC career
track. When picking my next job, I think it will come down to whether there's
a big opportunity in either track for mentorship and growth. I'll always
want to mix and match; I want to use both my leadership skills and technical
skills.

### Industry

I've never been very picky about what industry my employer is in. I lean toward
consumer products because I'm very motivated by connecting my work with end
users, but I'm very open to other ideas.

I would jump at the chance to work on a new desktop music app, or a creativity
tool.

### Size

I was happy in a 4-person startup, but less happy when it never grew.

The larger the company, the more I want to know about the specific team I'd
join. This is why I never got far with Google.

## How to sell me on an opportunity

Here's some information that might help you form a pitch.

### Things I like to do

* Give talks. I did a _lot_ of this in college but haven't had as many
  chances to do it over the past few years. This is partially my own fault.
* Write for fun, teaching, or documentation.
* Program computers. My GitHub profile shows 91 repositories, and that's
  just the public ones.
* Make music. I'm not optimistic about using this in a technology setting.
* Ship great stuff to people who appreciate it.
* Put good interfaces on complex tech.

### Things to mention

* Who will my manager be?
* Who will my peers be?
* How much of the team is new blood vs veterans, both in company tenure and
  total experience?

### Technology I like to work with

* Python
* Statically typed languages
* Native iOS and OS X

### Technology I do not like to work with

(Not deal breakers, though.)

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* React Native
* Hadoop
* Your in-house ORM or web framework if you are not Google or that ORM/web
  framework is not your actual product
* Anything with an incremental build time of more than 5 seconds

### Weirdly specific imaginary opportunities I would be excited about

#### The Manager-In-Waiting

You bring me on as a senior engineer/tech lead and either have me manage a
team when it makes sense, or help me grow in a non-management engineering
leadership role.

#### The First iOS Engineer

You need a native iOS app. You need it soon and you need it to be good. You
want me to write the app, hire some more iOS developers, and keep up with
the needs of the product.

#### The Second iOS Engineer

Just like the last one, but your first iOS engineer is AMAZING.

#### The Technical Cofounder

You somehow manage to convince me that the founding team can get from zero to
one and isn't made of sociopaths.
