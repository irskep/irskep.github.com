Title: How to hire me
Date: 2017-08-24

Hello! You're here because you're interested in hiring me. Here's a quick
outline of where I'm at and where I'm headed.

## Current position

I've been at Hipmunk on the mobile team since mid 2015. I've been managing my
team since late 2016. There are two Android engineers, one iOS engineer, and
me, also acting as an iOS engineer.

I spend about half my time programming, half managing.

The earliest I could arrive on my first day at a new job is probably
April 2018.

Hipmunk was acquired by SAP/Concur in October 2016.

## What I want

I want to grow as a leader and have fun at my job.

Specifically, I'm focusing on team lead or manager roles on iOS or iOS/Android
teams. I am weirdly passionate about iOS as a development platform.

## Cheat codes

If any of these things describe your company or the position, bringing it up
is a way to get past all my defenses. If none of them are true, don't worry!

* You are trying to un-break an industry that's been ruined by the internet,
  e.g. music, journalism, human communication.
* Your business model does not rely on ads or enterprise sales.
* Good documentation is at the core of your product or company culture.

## Deal breakers

* Long commute from Glen Park. My current commute is 30 minutes on a bike. It's
  my only exercise. Mountain View is too far. (Good remote work culture would
  mitigate this.) 
* Your company is likely helping to bring about the downfall of humanity or
  [some other sort of slow-motion apocalypse.](https://io9.gizmodo.com/william-gibson-on-the-apocalypse-america-and-the-peri-1656659382)
* Most of my time would be spent writing JavaScript. (Some is OK!)
 
One not-quite-deal-breaker: open office without quiet hours.

## Fun facts about Steve

Here's some information that might help you pitch me on your opportunity.

### Things I like doing

* Public speaking. I haven't done a conference in a while, but I'm comfortable
  in front of a crowd and I like giving technical talks. I've given about
  20 talks since 2007, some polished, some extemporaneous.
* Maintaining and promoting open source libraries.
* Writing for fun, for teaching, or for documentation. I've published blog posts
  while working at Yelp, Graffiti Labs, and Hipmunk.
* Making music.
* Shipping great stuff to people who appreciate it.
* Putting good interfaces on complex technology.

### Technologies I like to work with

* Python
* Statically typed languages
* Native iOS and OS X

### Technologies I do not like to work with

* Node.js
* React Native
* Hadoop
* MongoDB
* Home-grown web frameworks and ORMs
