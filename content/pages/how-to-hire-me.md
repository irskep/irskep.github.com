Title: How to hire me
Date: 2017-08-24

Hello! You're here because you're interested in hiring me. Here's a quick
outline of where I'm at and where I'm headed.

## Current position

I've been at Hipmunk on the mobile team since mid 2015. I've been my team's
manager since late 2016. There are two Android engineers, one iOS engineer, and
me, also acting as an iOS engineer.

I spend about half my time programming, half managing.

The earliest I could arrive on my first day at a new job is probably
mid-February 2018.

Hipmunk was acquired by SAP/Concur in October 2016.

## Career next steps

### Manager?

I'm tentatively interested in new management roles. I really like being a
multiplier on a team's productivity! But with only a year under my belt, I
worry about taking on a new challenge too soon. If you hire me, I will need
help. But I'm fully dedicated to becoming a great manager.

### Engineer?

I love programming! I'm open to joining a team as an individual contributor, but
there should be either leadership opportunities or radical autonomy.

See below for technology specifics.

### Early-stage startup generalist?

I love building new products as quickly as possible while maintaining quality.
I'm great at iOS, web frontend, and web backend development. I learn quickly. As
the company grows, I can take whatever leadership roles you need me to and step
back from coding.

But I'm not going to follow you very far down the "trade salary for equity"
path. Don't let that stop you from reaching out, though!

## Cheat codes

If any of these things describe your company or the position, bringing it up
is a way to get past all my defenses. If none of them are true, don't worry!

* You are trying to un-break an industry being ruined by the internet,
  e.g. music, journalism, human communication.
* Your business model does not involve ads or enterprise sales.
* Good documentation is at the core of your product or company culture.

## Deal breakers

* Long commute from Glen Park. My current commute is 30 minutes on a bike. It's
  my only exercise. Mountain View is too far. (Good remote work culture would
  mitigate this.) 
* Your company is likely helping to bring about the downfall of humanity or
  [some other sort of slow-motion apocalypse](https://io9.gizmodo.com/william-gibson-on-the-apocalypse-america-and-the-peri-1656659382).
* Most of my job would be writing JavaScript. (Some is OK!)
 
One not-quite-deal-breaker: open office without quiet hours.

## Fun facts about Steve

Here's some information that might help you pitch me on your opportunity.

### Things I like to do

* Public speaking. I haven't done a conference in a while, but I'm comfortable
  in front of a crowd and I like giving technical talks. I've given about
  20 talks since 2007, some polished, some extemporaneous.
* Writing for fun, for teaching, or for documentation. I've published blog posts
  while working at Yelp, Graffiti Labs, and Hipmunk.
* Making music.
* Shipping great stuff to people who appreciate it.
* Putting good interfaces on complex technology.

### Technology I like to work with

* Python
* Statically typed languages
* Native iOS and OS X

### Technology I do not like to work with

(Not deal breakers, though.)

* Node.js
* React Native
* Hadoop
* Home-grown web frameworks and ORMs
