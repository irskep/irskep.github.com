Title: Open source projects I work[ed] on
Slug: open-source

* [mrjob](http://github.com/Yelp/mrjob) lets you write MapReduce jobs in
  Python 2.5+ and run them on several platforms. I contributed a substantial
  part of the code through version 0.4 and still do code reviews and write
  documentation. mrjob is currently the most popular Python library for
  working with Hadoop as measured by Github stars.
* [Literally Canvas](http://literallycanvas.com) is an extensible HTML5 
  drawing widget. I'm trying to bring in-browser doodling to the masses in
  terms of both developers and users. It's the first thing I've started that's
  become reasonably popular.
* [Tron](http://github.com/Yelp/tron) is a centralized system for
  managing periodic batch processes and services across a cluster. I
  maintained Tron for a while at Yelp and wrote much of the documentation.
* [enzyme2sqlite](https://github.com/irskep/enzyme2sqlite) is a tiny tool to
  convert a bioinformatics-related flat file format to a badly schemad SQLite
  database. I mention it because I may have accrued up to two users.
* I've contributed code to the Elastic MapReduce part of
  [boto](https://github.com/boto/boto), the Python library for working with
  Amazon Web Services.
* I once sent a patch to the Mac version of [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org)
  because I like to see good libraries succeed.
