Escort a convoy of supply ships across hostile waters with your futuristic
airborne fighter. The original game was made for a 3-month [iDevGames](http://www.idevgames.com/) contest.

Will Hogben is primarily responsible for Escort Wing. I contributed about 10%
of the contest code as well as the music.
Will and an active community developed the game further for a couple of
years.

Escort Wing is written in BlitzMax, a BASIC-like layer over C++.
