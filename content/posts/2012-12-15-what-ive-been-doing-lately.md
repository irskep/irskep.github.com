Title: What I've been doing lately
Category: Side Channel
Tags: meta

I recently started my new job at Graffiti Labs after working at Yelp for
almost a year and a half. During that time, I did a lot of work on
[mrjob](http://mrjob.readthedocs.org/) and
[tron](http://packages.python.org/tron/).

Now I work on [Buildy](http://playbuildy.com), a collaborative sandbox
web game. I have a few technical blog posts over at the [Buildy
Blog](http://blog.playbuildy.com/). I also work on [Literally
Canvas](http://literallycanvas.com/), an open source HTML5 drawing widget.
