This Tuesday, Sendimals will be released to the iOS app store. It's a little
app I made with [Kelsey Bass](http://www.kelsey-bass.com/) that lets you
put together funny-looking creatures using body parts Kelsey drew. Here are
some examples:

Sendimals is integrated into the Messages app on iOS 10. That means you can
get to it from the keyboard area, like this:

# Why?

First, because I was inspired by the technology. New APIs like
this don't come along very often. Messaging is one of the primary uses of a
smartphone, and Messages extensions let you get right inside that flow. Knowing
Kelsey from [Space Train](/) meant we could do something really fun using our
unique skills and styles.

Second, I wanted a personal connection with the app store. I work at Hipmunk
by day, and I do write Hipmunk's iOS app and deal with the app store in that
capacity, but I don't think much about metrics, marketing, or design. Putting
my own app in the store gives me a lot more context.

And finally, I think it's important that independent developers make weird
things for tenuous reasons. In the same way that Messages extension give me
the ability to help you make weird things, it also gives major brands a way
to creep even further into your daily interactions.
