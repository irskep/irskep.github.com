Title: The New Dork Times
Tags: humor, projects

The best writing of my life was produced in 1997 when I was eight years old,
sitting at an old PC with my friend Eric Drury to write the New Dork Times.
Although it ran for only nine issues published between 1997 and 1999, its
biting social commentary remains as relevant as ever.

Earlier this year I came across my personal archives of all nine issues of the
New Dork Times and decided they were worth two hours of attention to bring to a
modern digital audience. I now present to you an online time capsule from 16
years ago:

**[The New Dork Times â€“ Digital Edition](http://steveasleep.com/newdorktimes/)**

I could only spare to hours from my normal archival duties of scanning bad
comics I drew when I was 7, so please forgive some shortcuts I took with the
layout and styling.
