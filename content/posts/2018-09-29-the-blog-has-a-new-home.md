Title: The blog has a new home

I've started blogging at
[blog.steveasleep.com](https://blog.steveasleep.com), hosted on
[write.as](https://write.as). I expect to keep the blog there going forward.
This site runs on [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/), which is
great for making static sites, but I've been doing a much better job of
writing consistently now that I can do it all from a web browser.
