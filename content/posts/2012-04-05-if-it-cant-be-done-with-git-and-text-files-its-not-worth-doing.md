Title: If It Can't Be Done with Git and Text Files, It's Not Worth Doing
Tags: meta

I am fed up with blogging sites. Since around 2003 (middle school), I've been
through plain HTML, HTML with CSS, Blogger, Wordpress, Posterous, Django,
Flask, and custom Python on Google App Engine. Now you're reading a set of
static files generated by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), with assistance from
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Twitter
Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap). I'm so trendy I can barely
stand it! Resize your browser window. I dare you.

Now I live in a bastion of maintainable CSS (well, [LESS](http://lesscss.org/))
and control all my own data. Goodbye walled gardens, slow servers, and complex
templating engines. Hello git and Markdown.

The [old blog](http://stevejohnson.posterous.com/) is still up*, but I moved
all of the stuff worth keeping over here.  Maybe one day I'll manage to write
about something other than programming here.

Edit from July 2013: I replaced Jekyll with Pelican and LESS with Sass because
I'm more familiar with them.

* No it's not. Posterous folded.
