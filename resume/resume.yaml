    summary: |
      As a manager, I supported the iOS and Android teams by coaching, mentoring, improving processes, and getting my hands dirty in code. In 2020, I decided to switch to a Staff Engineer role. I helped transform the iOS developer experience at Asana and shipped a lot of features.

      Throughout this time, I have been responsible for a few org-wide areas like maintaining the engineering blog, helping people release open source software, and running a tech talk series.

      After nine years doing iOS development, I switched stacks to be on the AI Workflows team in June 2024. So far, the shape of this work is writing TypeScript business logic and writing services in Python to support our AI efforts.
