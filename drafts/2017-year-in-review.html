    <div class="entry-content hyphenate"><p>This year I did a bunch of things, but one thing I didn’t do was blog about every single thing. Here’s a roundup of everything I&nbsp;missed.</p>
<h2 id="i-made-some-games">I made some&nbsp;games</h2>
<p>I made three games this year for Ludum Dare 38, 39, and 40: <a href="https://irskep.itch.io/roguebasement">Rogue Basement</a>, <a href="https://irskep.itch.io/powerq">Power-Q</a>, and <a href="http://steveasleep.com/please-come-in/">Please, Come In</a>. Their collective soundtracks contain five original&nbsp;songs.</p>
<p>The only one I really dedicated myself to during Ludum Dare was <em>Rogue Basement</em>, and it shows in the ratings. The other two were experiments with frameworks and genres. But I did polish <em>Power-Q</em> for an iOS release, and it’s probably going live on the app store this&nbsp;week!</p>
<p>It feels good to hit a new personal best in game releases, because it means I’m more motivated than ever to take my coding to creative places. And the consistent quality of each game demonstrates how much I’ve learned about game design over time. <em>Rogue Basement</em> and <em>Power-Q</em> eclipse every other game I’ve ever made. All 15-ish of&nbsp;them.</p>
<!-- idea: getting better at making games -->

<h2 id="i-wrote-some-open-source-libraries">I wrote some open source&nbsp;libraries**</h2>
<p>Early in the year, I was looking into ways to manage a local music collection and make playback control available to everyone on my home network. After becoming frustrated with the mpd ecosystem and discovering <a href="http://beets.io">beets</a>, I wrote a collection of Python and JavaScript code called <a href="https://github.com/irskep/summertunes">Summertunes</a> to marry beets to the <a href="http://mpv.io"><span class="caps">MPV</span></a> player with an iTunes-like web interface. Eventually I wrote some small patches for beets and packaged it all up as a beets plugin and Python package. But I haven’t made any noise about it at all because it’s a lot of trouble to set up, and some features aren’t as reliable as I’d&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>Before writing <em>Rogue Basement</em>, I wrote <a href="http://steveasleep.com/clubsandwich/">clubsandwich</a>. It’s a framework for making roguelikes in Python 3 built on the <a href="http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal">BearLibTerminal</a> retro-terminal-style rendering <span class="amp">&amp;</span> input library. It has comprehensive documentation and&nbsp;examples.</p>
<p>Before writing <em>Please, Come In</em>, I wrote <a href="http://steveasleep.com/jumbogrove/">Jumbo Grove</a>. It’s a framework for writing interactive fiction in JavaScript built on <a href="http://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>. It has comprehensive documentation and&nbsp;examples.</p>
<p>(Obviously there’s a theme to the last two, and it’s a topic I plan to write about&nbsp;soon.)</p>
<p>This year I made a very small number of changes to <a href="http://literallycanvas.com">Literally Canvas</a>. I am still mystified by the popularity of this library. Or, mystified that no one else is interested in maintaining it despite it being part of their money-making&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>And finally, I helped the <a href="http://pyglet.readthedocs.io">pyglet</a> project overhaul its documentation tooling. They had used epydoc for years and had switched to a hacky Sphinx setup that was breaking down on recent Python and Sphinx releases. (I did something similar for <a href="http://pillow.readthedocs.io">pillow</a> in&nbsp;2015.)</p>
<!-- idea: my approach to writing new libraries -->

<h2 id="i-worked-on-some-apps">I worked on some&nbsp;apps</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the year, I got involved with <a href="http://ragtag.team">Ragtag</a> and started working on a tool for publishing political calls to action. I made an <span class="caps">MVP</span>, but wasn’t able to drum up any interest, so I abandoned it. This and another potential project taught me that I don’t have the mental energy to take on projects that amount to second jobs: projects with teams, external requirements, and tools I don’t happen to be interested in. I have a lot of raw output, but unless a project follows my obsession of the month and has no stakes, it’s draining instead of energizing. Donating money is much easier. I don’t want to burn&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>At some point I decided to take a structured approach to working through my 3-digit Steam backlog. I imported everything into <a href="http://completionator.com">Completionator</a>, wrote a scraper for its Excel export feature, and wrote  a <a href="https://github.com/irskep/completionator-cli">command line tool</a> to suggest games for me to play. (While kind of neat, this approach didn’t work because I still buy Humble Bundles faster than I can get through the&nbsp;games&#8230;)</p>
<p>Late in the year, I made a small <span class="caps">UI</span> polish update to <a href="http://sendimals.com">Sendimals</a> and stuck some Google ads at the bottom of the top-level screen. Sendimals now has revenue of two dollars per month. I developed a new way of coloring body parts (our #1 feature request) but haven’t yet found the motivation to update all the <span class="caps">UI</span> and data structures to support&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="i-made-some-videos">I made some&nbsp;videos</h2>
<p>I sort of have a YouTube channel now. I made it to host my <em>Rogue Basement</em> timelapse and update videos. Later on, I got the idea to dig up my old games, get them running on modern macOS, and do video captures for&nbsp;posterity.</p>
<h2 id="i-learned-some-new-tech">I learned some new&nbsp;tech</h2>
<p>My weapons of choice are Python 3, Swift, and <span class="caps">ES6</span>. I didn’t branch out from those languages this year, but there was a lot to learn within those&nbsp;domains.</p>
<p>In the JavaScript world, I learned about <span class="caps">HTML5</span> audio, and built a library on Vue.js. (Yeah, it really is better than&nbsp;React.)</p>
<p>In Apple’s domain, I learned SpriteKit, GameplayKit, and the Entity-Component-System design&nbsp;pattern.</p>
<p>I dug deep into the world of roguelikes this year. It’s a really fun genre to work in as a programmer, because you can go as shallow or deep as you want in different aspects of game design. I spent a lot of time with game architecture design patterns and procedural level&nbsp;algorithms.</p>
<!-- idea: why vue.js is great for writing libs for noobs -->

<h2 id="i-discovered-some-tools">I discovered some&nbsp;tools</h2>
<p>2017 was the year I discovered <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>. They’re doing an amazing job of cultivating the Truly Indie™ game scene. They basically run the bar where all the up-and-coming local bands play, except “local” is&nbsp;“everywhere.” </p>
<p>While making art for Power-Q, I discovered <a href="https://aseprite.org">Aseprite</a>, by far the best pixel art tool in&nbsp;existence.</p>
<h2 id="i-became-a-better-drummer">I became a better&nbsp;drummer</h2>
<p>I practice drums 2-4 days a week after work and over the weekend. I can’t really claim any milestones here, but if my band ever gets off the ground, you might get a chance to hear me on an <span class="caps">EP</span>!</p>
<h2 id="i-played-a-lot-of-video-games">I played a lot of video&nbsp;games</h2>
<p>This isn’t really an achievement, but here’s a random Games of the Year list in the middle of a post about creative&nbsp;output.</p>
<p><strong>The Steve Johnson Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&nbsp;Awards</strong></p>
<p>Out Of The Park Baseball 2016 and <span class="caps">XCOM</span>&nbsp;2</p>
<p><strong>The Steve Johnson This Is A Good Roguelike&nbsp;Awards</strong></p>
<p>Tales of Maj’Eyal 4 and&nbsp;HyperRogue</p>
<p><strong>The Steve Johnson I Don’t Hate This First Person Shooter&nbsp;Awards</strong></p>
<p>Ziggurat and Borderlands&nbsp;2</p>
<p><strong>The Steve Johnson This Game Deserves An Award&nbsp;Awards</strong></p>
<p>Rocket League and The&nbsp;Witness</p>
<h2 id="when-i-write-all-that-out-it-seems-like-a-lot">When I write all that out it seems like a&nbsp;lot</h2>
<p>Those are the things I did with my nights and weekends in 2017! In retrospect, it looks like I overdid it. Next year I’m hoping to tone it down a bit and spend more time with human&nbsp;beings.</p></div>
