    <div class="entry-content hyphenate"><p>Over the holidays someone gave me a copy of the first programming book I ever
read. In rereading it, I found almost as much as when I first experienced it at
nine years&nbsp;old.</p>
<p><img alt="Book cover" src="http://steveasleep.com/img/content/basic_programming_for_kids.jpg" title="**BASIC Programming for Kids** by Roz Ault" /></p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is that since it was published in 1983, I
didn&#8217;t know how to find an interpreter for the code in 1999. All examples were
run via thought experiment. Because of this fact, I think that this book did
more to get me excited about the idea of programming than it did to impart
knowledge. In this way, I think it follows a higher-level version of the &#8220;give
a man a fish&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;saying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book will teach you how to write simple programs in <span class="caps">BASIC</span> for your
computer. Its purpose, however, is not to make you a programmer. Its purpose
is to help you understand computers, to think about how computers can help
you in all kinds of ways, and to discover how much fun you can have when you
learn how to talk to&nbsp;computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p><strong><span class="caps">BASIC</span> Programming for Kids</strong> explains how to write simple <span class="caps">BASIC</span> programs for
The Apple <span class="caps">II</span>+/e, Atari 400/800, Commodore 64/<span class="caps">PET</span>/<span class="caps">VIC</span> 20, <span class="caps">TI</span> 99/4A, Timex
Sinclair 1000, and <span class="caps">TRS</span>-80. (The programs still run in Chipmunk Basic.) The fact
that such a book could be written for ten different platforms is a testament to
the ubiquity of <span class="caps">BASIC</span> in personal computers at the time, but the book does
spend a lot of time explaining special cases and how to rewrite the examples so
that they run on some of the platforms. (Apparently the Timex Sinclair 1000 was
an awful&nbsp;machine.)</p>
<p>It begins with a 30-page chapter on how to type and use the prompts on the
various platforms. Then the language is taught over ten chapters, with
exercises at the end of each chapter. There is a final chapter with some
example programs, and then appendices for reference, troubleshooting, editing,
and information about computers in&nbsp;general.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick example to refresh your <span class="caps">BASIC</span>&nbsp;memory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>NEW
10 FOR J = 1 TO 5 
20 PRINT &quot;JUMP&quot;;J 
30 FOR C = 1 TO 3 
40 PRINT &quot;CLAP&quot;;C 
50 NEXT C 
60 NEXT J 
RUN
</pre></div>


<p>After rereading the book cover to cover, I have only two new thoughts. First,
that the author did a good job of conveying the joy of computing to young
readers. Second, that the <span class="caps">BASIC</span> language was an awful mess but succeeded for
very good&nbsp;reasons.</p>
<h2 id="review-positive">Review:&nbsp;Positive</h2>
<p>This is a good book. I&#8217;m glad I found it when I went looking for it. Here&#8217;s an
example that follows a description of what variables&nbsp;are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can put variables in a program, like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>NEW
10 N = 2
20 X = 5
30 PRINT N + X
</pre></div>


<p>What will that program print? Run it and see if you guessed correctly. Notice
that lines 10 and 20 don&#8217;t make anything happen on the screen when you run
the program. They tell the program to do something <em>inside</em> the computer, but
only the word <span class="caps">PRINT</span> makes a message appear on the&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>Now change lines 10 and 20 to give the variables some different&nbsp;values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a small, self-contained, understandable example with a concise, complete
explanation and an invitation to experiment. In this way, it mirrors the style
of Zed Shaw&#8217;s <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.com/">Learn Python The Hard
Way</a>. It never blames the reader for
being wrong, and in fact seems to encourage the reader to forgive his or her
own mistakes while writing&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>So yes, it&#8217;s a good book. But about this <span class="caps">BASIC</span>&nbsp;thing&#8230;</p>
<h2 id="basic-sucked-but-worse-was-better"><span class="caps">BASIC</span> Sucked, But Worse Was&nbsp;Better</h2>
<p>Seriously, what is this crap? Specifying a line number for each statement
before the program is finished? <span class="caps">REM</span>? <em>No proper functions?</em> How did anyone
survive&nbsp;this?</p>
<p>Oh, the alternative was to use assembly, or to slip into an <span class="caps">AI</span> laboratory.&nbsp;Right.</p>
<p>The two great things about <span class="caps">BASIC</span> as it existed in personal computers was that
it was <em>extremely</em> simple, and it was <em>everywhere</em>. Ault was able to describe
almost the entire language with extensive examples in a hundred pages of large
print, and those pages covered the vast majority of PCs on the market at the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The reason I was able to understand the book without actually using a computer
was because of the simplicity of <span class="caps">BASIC</span> and because of Ault&#8217;s ability to explain
it using terms no more complex than necessary. At this point I should mention
that this book may not actually be the very first programming book I read, but
it was certainly the first one I understood. I really don&#8217;t&nbsp;remember.</p>
<h2 id="and-also-worse">&#8230;And Also&nbsp;Worse</h2>
<p>Before rereading this book, I had mostly forgotten what <span class="caps">BASIC</span> really was, and
didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with the statement that <span class="caps">BASIC</span> causes brain damage. Now
I agree wholeheartedly, and I speak from experience. <span class="caps">BASIC</span> crippled me for&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>At its core, <span class="caps">BASIC</span> is a crappy way to express a state machine. The syntax
encourages tight, unreadable balls of spaghetti. <code>GOSUB</code> is a poor way to break
out functions. Most of the punctuation feels very ad&nbsp;hoc.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but contrast this mess with Scheme. All other concerns aside,
Scheme makes a great teaching language because there is almost no syntax and
code is inherently hierarchical. Beginners simply learn new words. Everything
else is&nbsp;gravy.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t learn Scheme, I learned <span class="caps">BASIC</span> and stuck with it for about six
years. I went from <a href="http://www.truebasic.com/">TrueBASIC</a> to <a href="http://www.vellios.com/2010/06/06/basic-compiler-opensourced/">Visual
MacStandardBasic</a>
to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080321015004/www.iit.edu/~sarimar/GDS/metal.html"><span class="caps">METAL</span>
<span class="caps">BASIC</span></a>
to <a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/">BlitzMax</a>. I would occasionally try to learn a
new language, but would quickly become frustrated with the lack of easy-to-use
IDEs and graphics libraries. (During this period I was writing nothing but&nbsp;games.)</p>
<p>Languages like <span class="caps">METAL</span> <span class="caps">BASIC</span> had few features and libraries, but for me that was
as much of a strength as it was a weakness. Rather than spending hours
searching for which giant package to import, I could browse a complete list of
commands less than twenty pages long to find what I needed, modules and
namespaces be damned. When I was done writing a game, I could click &#8220;Compile&#8221;
and email it to my friends instead of asking them to download Joe Shmoe Player
3000 or tearing my hair out over config files. (For this reason, I think
Processing and BlitzMax are currently the best platforms to learn game
programming&nbsp;with.)</p>
<p>I spent so much time in the game bubble that I missed out on many early
opportunities to learn new language&nbsp;concepts.</p>
<h2 id="what-everyone-knows-is-wrong-today">What Everyone Knows Is Wrong&nbsp;Today</h2>
<p>Today&#8217;s popular languages are objectively better than <span class="caps">BASIC</span> in every way.
Features, syntax, libraries, the works. But for a kid who wants to write games
by typing into a window and clicking <span class="caps">COMPILE</span> or <span class="caps">RUN</span>, the language options are
limited to Processing, BlitzMax, and whatever GameMaker uses. None of these
are real-world languages, so anyone starting out with them will not have a
smooth transition to the next stage in their development as a master of&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t bother rehashing what others have said about this problem or yearn for
the days of the <span class="caps">BASIC</span>-prompt-as-main-interface. I&#8217;ll just say this: make better
tools, write more books and&nbsp;tutorials.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.inventwithpython.com/">Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</a>
is comparable to <em><span class="caps">BASIC</span> Programming for Kids</em>. Better, even. Python&#8217;s tools are
not ideal for children, but they are good enough to teach programming&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to create games with a good write/run/distribute tool, but
not necessarily with good documentation for those new to&nbsp;programming:</p>
