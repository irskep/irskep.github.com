I made <a href=https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/rogue-basement>Rogue Basement</a>, a bare-bones, single-level game with <span class=caps>ASCII</span>&nbsp;graphics.</p> <p>In this article, I&#8217;ll cover the game design decisions I made, how they affect the player&#8217;s experience, and a bit of how they&#8217;re implemented. <a href=https://github.com/irskep/rogue_basement>The source code</a> is extensively commented as&nbsp;well.</p> <p><img alt=screenshot src=http://localhost:8001/img/rogue_basement/screenshot2.png></p> <h1>What is a&nbsp;roguelike?</h1> <p>A &#8220;roguelike&#8221; is a game that is &#8220;like Rogue,&#8221; a text-based game from the 1980s that looks like&nbsp;this:</p> <p><img alt=Rogue_Screen_Shot_CAR.png src=http://localhost:8001/img/rogue_basement/257BD0D6AB2E10E523C6F74028CBC005.png></p> <p>Typical features of these games&nbsp;include:</p> <ul> <li>Procedurally generated&nbsp;levels</li> <li>Permadeath (one&nbsp;life)</li> <li>Turn-based&nbsp;action</li> <li>Top-down 2D graphics, often just&nbsp;text</li> <li>Simulation-oriented; interesting stories arise from the game&#8217;s rules and&nbsp;behavior</li> <li>Very difficult to win without lots of&nbsp;practice</li> </ul> <p>The combination of these features makes the games fun to play over and over again. You have to play a lot to get good, but since the game is procedurally generated, you&#8217;re always facing new situations. You have to use your wits to&nbsp;survive.</p> <h1>Environment</h1> <p>I started on Friday night with a level generator. When you&#8217;re time-constrained, you have to make very careful decisions about where to innovate, and I chose to stick to a roguelike trope for my basic layout: boxy rooms connected by narrow corridors, with doors where corridors meet&nbsp;rooms.</p> <p>I could have placed a bunch of rooms randomly and made sure each one was connected to another, but it&#8217;s tricky to use space efficiently that way. A common way to avoid this problem is to use a <strong>binary space partitioning&nbsp;tree.</strong></p> <p>The basic idea here is that you take a rectangular area, like&nbsp;this:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>+----------------------------------------+

</code></pre></div> <p>And here&#8217;s how it looked during&nbsp;development:</p> <p><img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-21 21.50.39.png" src=http://localhost:8001/img/rogue_basement/B74AF325D250255EA7B86A64BE1AAFD0.png></p> <p>We now have a few&nbsp;guarantees:</p> <ul> <li>All rooms are reachable from all other&nbsp;rooms.</li> <li>No rooms&nbsp;intersect.</li> <li>For a given pair of room groups (everything under <code>a</code> vs everything under <code>b</code>, for example), there is exactly one path between&nbsp;them.</li> </ul> <p>That last point has some good and bad ramifications. On the bad side, it worsens replayability, because the corridors are roughly organized the same way from game to game. I noticed this while playtesting; after 3 games it&#8217;s obvious that the rooms generally have the same&nbsp;layout.</p> <p>But those characteristics allowed me to take a simple approach to matching the theme of Ludum Dare 38: &#8220;A Small World.&#8221; The first two splits don&#8217;t have to be random; if they always split the sections evenly, then the map will have 4 even quadrants. I used this to create 4 distinct areas of increasing difficulty, so I could have a &#8220;one-level roguelike&#8221; with some actual&nbsp;progression.</p> <p>I split up the map like&nbsp;this:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code><span class=o>+-------------------+--------------------+</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>The player starts in <code>aa</code> and moves to <code>ab</code>, then <code>bb</code>, then <code>ba</code>, where the goal&nbsp;is.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s another map from early development, which splits the map in this&nbsp;way:</p> <p><img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-22 10.54.30.png" src=http://localhost:8001/img/rogue_basement/2EE2A79C08555276A852AAEA4DBEA9C7.png></p> <p>And here&#8217;s one with just the first two partition lines, so you can see how the map is&nbsp;divided:</p> <p><img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-22 10.56.58.png" src=http://localhost:8001/img/rogue_basement/6F0FA752B4F575565A46B67ABF9120B6.png></p> <p>And finally, here are the hallways that mark the transitions between each&nbsp;section:</p> <p><img alt="Screenshot 2017-04-22 11.40.44.png" src=http://localhost:8001/img/rogue_basement/360C018F2FCC756A1A59049EB36E67AA.png></p> <p>Originally the colors were just for debugging, but I ended up leaving them in place because they signal&nbsp;specialness.</p> <p>To add variety, I created a <code>rooms.csv</code> file to define a few room&nbsp;types:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>                                                      Monster   Item

</code></pre></div> <p>So within each quadrant, there is an 80% chance a room will have shape <code>box_random</code>, a quadrant-specific color, 5 monsters per 100 tiles, 5 items per 100 tiles, and allow any area-appropriate monster. But there is a 20% chance that the room will have the shape <code>box_full</code> (fill its entire <span class=caps>BSP</span> tree cell) and contain only verps, 2 per 100&nbsp;tiles.</p> <h1>Inhabitants</h1> <h2>The&nbsp;player</h2> <p>The first inhabitant of the world is the player, represented by an <code>@</code> (because the cell with the <code>@</code> is &#8220;where you are at&#8221;). All world inhabitants, henceforth called &#8220;monsters&#8221; (after all, humans are the real monsters) and defined in <code>monsters.csv</code>:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>id,     Char, Color,    Difficulty, Chance, Behaviors,          hp_max, strength, items
player, @,    #ffffff,  -1,         0.00,   keyboard_movement,  100,    5.00,
</code></pre></div> <p><span class=dquo>&#8220;</span>Difficulty&#8221; determines which quadrant a monster can spawn in. The player is a special case, so the level generator ignores it. The player moves in response to keyboard events, has 100 hit points, and hits other monsters for 5 damage. (The combat system in Rogue Basement is not sophisticated. There is no randomness. Remember, I had to be careful about where to spend&nbsp;innovation-points!)</p> <h2>NPCs</h2> <p>Generally speaking, NPCs (non-player characters) in video games and tabletop RPGs are differentiated based on three important&nbsp;things:</p> <ol> <li>What they can&nbsp;do</li> <li>How they&nbsp;behave</li> <li>How many hits they take to kill, depending on what the player can&nbsp;do</li> </ol> <p>All of those things affect the player&#8217;s behavior, strategy, and tactics. For a time-constrained game like Rogue Basement, I wanted to stick to the absolute&nbsp;basics.</p> <p>The monsters are all defined in a <span class=caps>CSV</span> file (<code>monsters.csv</code>). The very first monster I added was <code>v</code>, the&nbsp;&#8220;verp&#8221;:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>id,     Char, Color,    Difficulty, Chance, Behaviors,          hp_max, strength, items
verp,   v,    #ffff00,  0.00,       1.00,   beeline_visible,    10,     2.00,
                                            |random_walk
</code></pre></div> <p>In human terms, that definition reads as: &#8220;The &#8216;verp&#8217; monster, represented by a yellow <code>v</code>, appears in difficulty-zero rooms (first quadrant) with a random weight of 1.0, moves randomly unless it sees the player in which case it moves toward them, has 10 hit points, does 2 damage to the player when hitting, and has no items at the game&nbsp;start.&#8221;</p> <p>Behaviors are implemented as Python classes. After the player moves, each monster has a chance to move as well. Behaviors can be stacked, meaning that if one behavior decides it can&#8217;t do anything, control can be passed to the next behavior in the list. So the verp&#8217;s <code>beeline_visible</code> behavior either says &#8220;I see the player, I move toward them&#8221; or &#8220;I do not see the player, let some other behavior act this&nbsp;turn.&#8221;</p> <p>After adding the verps, I wanted to balance them out with a monster that attacks from a distance. I started by defining a behavior <code>range_5_visible</code> which acts like <code>beeline_visible</code>, but instead of trying to move onto the player&#8217;s space, the monster tries to be exactly 5 tiles away. If the player approaches the monster, it will run away unless it is backed into a&nbsp;corner.</p> <p>I attached this behavior to a new enemy type, the <code>wibble</code> (<code>w</code>). But a monster that only runs away isn&#8217;t very challenging! So it was time to deepen the simulation by adding&nbsp;items.</p> <p>Items have simple&nbsp;characteristics:</p> <ul> <li>Monsters (including the player) can hold them in an unlimited&nbsp;inventory.</li> <li>When a monster dies, its items are dropped on the&nbsp;ground.</li> </ul> <p>I only had time to add one kind of item: the rock (<code>*</code>). The rock has one use: you can throw it. When you do, the game spawns a new enemy with this&nbsp;definition:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>id,             Char, Color,    Difficulty, Chance, Behaviors,        hp_max, strength, items
rock_in_flight, *,    #c1a073,  -1,         0,      path_until_hit,   2,      2,
</code></pre></div> <p>Since its &#8220;difficulty&#8221; is -1, it never spawns in the initial level. Its only behavior is to move along a path until it hits a wall, a monster, or the player. It has 2 hit&nbsp;points.</p> <p>This is a special item, so the game ignores the <code>strength</code> and <code>items</code> attributes in the <span class=caps>CSV</span> file. Instead, the <code>rock_in_flight</code><span class=quo>&#8216;</span>s strength value is taken from <em>the monster that threw the rock</em>, and the original rock item is added to the <code>rock_in_flight</code><span class=quo>&#8216;</span>s inventory! When the <code>rock_in_flight</code><span class=quo>&#8216;</span>s <code>path_until_hit</code> behavior detects that its life is over, the <code>rock_in_flight</code> <span class=dquo>&#8220;</span>dies&#8221; and the contents of its inventory (the <code>rock</code>) are dropped on the&nbsp;ground.</p> <p>Now that I had throwable rocks, I could put a couple in each <code>wibble</code><span class=quo>&#8216;</span>s inventory and give them the ability to throw them. The <code>wibble</code> definition looked like&nbsp;this:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>id,     Char, Color,    Difficulty, Chance, Behaviors,          hp_max, strength, items
wibble, w,    #90582c,  0.00,       20,     range_5_visible     10,     2,        ROCKx1
                                              |throw_rock_slow
                                              |sleep,
</code></pre></div> <p>I added a &#8220;sleep&#8221; behavior to differentiate wibbles from verps. When the player isn&#8217;t around, verps are hyperactive and run around randomly; wibbles sit and meditate. It seemed in keeping with their fighting&nbsp;styles.</p> <p>That all worked great, but when wibbles ran out of rocks, the game got really easy! So I added another behavior, <code>pick_up_rocks</code>, which makes a wibble either move toward any adjacent rocks, or pick them up if it&#8217;s standing on&nbsp;one.</p> <p>The &#8220;conservation of rocks&#8221; principle introduces a new tactic into the game: players can pick up all the rocks to deprive the wibbles of their ammunition. Fortunately the player&#8217;s backpack is infinitely&nbsp;large!</p> <h2>Stun&nbsp;effect</h2> <p>At this point, combat consisted of punching verps and dodging or punching rocks. (Yeah, you can punch rocks! They are just monsters after all!) I wanted to make it possible to avoid almost all damage, though, by understanding the game&#8217;s systems, and the verps made it too hard to do that by being&nbsp;relentless.</p> <p>So I made every hit by the player stun the target monster for 2 turns. This is done using a behavior called <code>stunnable</code>, which just says &#8220;if I&#8217;ve been hit within the last 2 turns, turn blue and do&nbsp;nothing.&#8221;</p> <p>For experienced roguelike players this makes the game easy once you figure it out, but I believe it&#8217;s still a rewarding experience to figure it out in the first place. It is very, very difficult to make a game by yourself in 48 hours that has more than a few minutes of worthwhile gameplay, so I was aiming to just make those few minutes as good as possible and then let players feel like they could put it down after a good&nbsp;experience.</p> <h2>Healing</h2> <p>To make each section its own challenge, I decided to have the colored hallways between sections heal the player completely. This is another difficulty decrease that I could probably have left out, but I decided to err on the side of easy because I knew I had some user interface issues and wanted to be &#8220;extra&#8221; fair to&nbsp;players.</p> <h1>Unintended&nbsp;consequences</h1> <p>The simulation has a few features I didn&#8217;t intend, but that I don&#8217;t regret—that&#8217;s half the&nbsp;fun!</p> <p>These features mainly have to do with rocks, and the fact that when you throw them, they become monsters.&nbsp;Specifically:</p> <ul> <li>You can punch rocks out of the&nbsp;air.</li> <li>If you throw a rock, and then walk in its direction, you will punch it dead before it has a chance to&nbsp;move.</li> <li>If two wibbles throw rocks at you at the same time, they may collide in midair and&nbsp;die.</li> <li>You can embed rocks in walls. (Okay, not so happy about this&nbsp;one.)</li> </ul> <h1>Atmosphere</h1> <h2>Music</h2> <p>I took 90 minutes to write 4 tracks, adding up to 11 minutes of music. Each map quadrant plays one of the tracks. <a href=https://soundcloud.com/irskep/sets/rogue-basement-ost>You can listen to them&nbsp;here.</a></p> <p>The music fades down when you&#8217;re in a colored hallway and fades up again when you enter a room in a map quadrant. My intention is to build tension and give the player a clue, in addition to the different colors, that the monsters are about to get&nbsp;tougher.</p> <h2>Title&nbsp;screen</h2> <p>I made this adorable title screen, and reused the <span class=caps>ASCII</span> art in the&nbsp;manual:</p> <p><img alt="title screen" src=http://localhost:8001/img/rogue_basement/screenshot1.png></p> <h1>Final&nbsp;scores</h1> <p>There were 1,104 &#8220;compo&#8221; (48-hour, one person) games, of which 549 had enough ratings to get scored and ranked. Here are the scores for Rogue Basement. Percentiles are within the 549 ranked&nbsp;games.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Category</th> <th>Rank</th> <th>Percentile</th> <th>Score</th> <th># ratings</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Overall</td> <td>135</td> <td>75.4</td> <td>3.667</td> <td>47</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fun</td> <td>179</td> <td>67.4</td> <td>3.409</td> <td>46</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Innovation</td> <td>379</td> <td>31.0</td> <td>2.841</td> <td>46</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Theme</td> <td>398</td> <td>25.5</td> <td>2.977</td> <td>46</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Graphics</td> <td>374</td> <td>31.9</td> <td>2.932</td> <td>46</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Audio</td> <td>24</td> <td>95.7</td> <td>4.000</td> <td>44</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Humor</td> <td>157</td> <td>71.5</td> <td>3.000</td> <td>42</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mood</td> <td>94</td> <td>82.9</td> <td>3.659</td> <td>43</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>I&#8217;m most interested in ratings as a measurement of how well-spent my effort was in each area of the game. When you only have 48 hours to make a game, you get on a path early and it&#8217;s hard to get off of it if something isn&#8217;t working. That adds an enormous luck factor to things like &#8220;Fun&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;Innovation.&#8221;</p> <p>It looks like the soundtrack was my secret weapon. Audio got a great score, and I&#8217;m guessing that gave me a boost in Mood and&nbsp;Overall.</p> <p>The Theme score is very low, which I&#8217;m a little surprised at but also don&#8217;t care&nbsp;about.</p> <p>Innovation was one of my dump stats this round, so its low score makes sense too. I did make a very by-the-book&nbsp;roguelike.</p> <p>Graphics was my other dump stat in that I used <span class=caps>ASCII</span>, but I&#8217;m a little hurt that people didn&#8217;t appreciate the aesthetic&nbsp;more.</p> <p>Humor was a wildcard. I mostly use humor in my games to <a href=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging>lampshade</a> silly situations or mechanics. Rogue Basement just has some flavor text and <span class=caps>ASCII</span> art to justify your situation. I guess people appreciated it. (There&#8217;s also some not-so-great English in the log messages, and that might have played a&nbsp;part.)</p> <h1>Takeaways</h1> <h2>Scope</h2> <p>Features I had planned to add but&nbsp;didn&#8217;t:</p> <ul> <li>Multiple basements and an&nbsp;overworld</li> <li>Health&nbsp;potions</li> <li>Fire/ice&nbsp;missiles</li> <li>2 more enemy types to use those&nbsp;missiles</li> </ul> <p>From past experience, I knew that scope was always a problem, so I tackled the highest-priority mechanics first, which means I ended up with a real game instead of a tech&nbsp;demo.</p> <h2>Difficulty is&nbsp;hard</h2> <p>It&#8217;s very difficult to tune for difficulty without time to playtest and fix things! I kept making the game easier because developers almost always make games too hard on the first pass, and I wanted to overcompensate to make it more likely that people would finish it in one&nbsp;sitting.</p> <p>The feedback so far seems to indicate that the difficulty is just about right. No one says it&#8217;s too hard, and some people say they&#8217;ve been playing for 25 minutes(!!!) and haven&#8217;t beaten it&nbsp;yet.</p> <h2>CSVs and roguelikes are best&nbsp;friends</h2> <p>Every time I moved some data out of Python code into a <span class=caps>CSV</span> file, it got 10x easier to add new content, but not for the reason you might thing. Yes, copy/pasting <span class=caps>CSV</span> rows is an easy way to add new things, but the act of <em>designing</em> the file format made me think about how the whole program worked and put flexible systems in place that would let me do more cool stuff&nbsp;later.</p> <p>I can already see the limitations of <span class=caps>CSV</span>, so I think next I&#8217;m going to switch to <span class=caps>CSV</span>, but with <span class=caps>YAML</span> values for each column. I really like the efficiency of editing <span class=caps>CSV</span>, but it&#8217;s not flexible enough to do what I&nbsp;want.</p> <h2>Preparation&nbsp;matters</h2> <p>The week before Ludum Dare 38, I worked on an <span class=caps>ASCII</span> user interface and roguelike development framework. I didn&#8217;t want to spend a bunch of time making a crappy title screen, I wanted to focus on gameplay! By writing and releasing the framework, I had all the relevant APIs in memory as soon as the competition started, and I could get going immediately on the important&nbsp;stuff.</p> <h2>Music makes a&nbsp;difference</h2> <p>The music is really simple, but it adds a huge amount of atmosphere and is a strong signal of progression. It was time well spent, especially since when I made it (the middle of the night) my programmer brain wasn&#8217;t working anymore. Most of the positive reviews mention the&nbsp;music.</p> <h2><span class=caps>ASCII</span> helps you focus on mechanics but has a score&nbsp;cost</h2> <p>Since <span class=caps>ASCII</span> is traditional for roguelikes, I thought I wouldn&#8217;t lose too many points in graphics. In my opinion, good <span class=caps>ASCII</span> is better than bad pixel art. But I was wrong, and I was ranked in the bottom 35% of scored&nbsp;games.</p> <p>Even though I lost points on graphics, I&#8217;m glad I went with <span class=caps>ASCII</span>, because it gave me a lot more time to focus on mechanics and the design of my engine. I would consider using <span class=caps>ASCII</span> again next time, graphics score be&nbsp;damned.</p> <h2>Making videos ameliorates&nbsp;loneliness</h2> <p>Whenever I felt like I hit a milestone, I did a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzdytAQSpVhUCVgJvtgDNEQ2DI41KiKr">video update</a>. I didn&#8217;t really expect anyone to watch them, but it helped give me perspective on my progress. And it simulated human interaction a little bit, which was nice because I was alone in the house for the entire&nbsp;weekend.</p> <h2>The tech stack&nbsp;works</h2> <p>I wrote the game in Python 3. For graphics, I used <a href=http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal>BearLibTerminal</a>. I played the music with <a href=https://pyglet.org>pyglet</a>. And for assorted algorithms, state management, and user interface features, I used my own <a href=https://steveasleep.com/clubsandwich/ >clubsandwich</a> library. To package the game for <span class=caps>OS</span> X and Windows, I used <a href=http://www.pyinstaller.org/ >PyInstaller</a>.</p> <p>This combination works really well. The main downside is that calling C libraries from Python is slow, and I had to do some optimiziation work to get a decent frame rate. In the future, I might switch the graphics over to use pyglet entirely, but I really like using BearLibTerminal because of its limitations. You get a grid of tiles and nothing else. It&#8217;s&nbsp;liberating.</p> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>This is probably the most fun game I have ever made, and ties for most fun making a game alongside my last Ludum Dare&nbsp;success.</p> <p>Thanks for reading!
